# SuperSeed SuperGame Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted to identify and mitigate potential cheating methods in the SuperSeed TetriSeed game. The audit focused on client-side manipulation techniques commonly used to gain unfair advantages in browser-based games, particularly those that impact leaderboard integrity.

Several vulnerabilities were identified that could allow users to manipulate game mechanics, including:
1. Piece manipulation (forcing all I-pieces)
2. Game speed manipulation
3. Function override/tampering
4. Score manipulation

We have implemented multiple layers of anti-cheat protections to detect and respond to these manipulations, ensuring fair gameplay and leaderboard integrity.

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Piece Manipulation
**Severity: High**

Users could override the `randomTetromino` function in the browser console to always return I-pieces (the most valuable for clearing lines), giving them an unfair advantage:

```javascript
// Example exploit code
window.randomTetromino = function() {
  return TETROMINOS['I'];
};
```

### 2. Game Speed Manipulation
**Severity: High**

Users could modify the `dropTime` variable to slow down the game significantly, making it much easier to position pieces:

```javascript
// Example exploit code
window.slowGame = function() {
  const tetrisRoot = document.querySelector('.tetris');
  const component = Object.values(tetrisRoot)[0];
  component.stateNode.setState({dropTime: 5000}); // 5 seconds per drop
}
```

### 3. Function Tampering
**Severity: Medium**

Users could replace core game functions with custom implementations that bypass game rules or collision detection:

```javascript
// Example exploit code
const originalCheckCollision = window.checkCollision;
window.checkCollision = function() { 
  return false; // Never detect collisions
};
```

### 4. Score Manipulation
**Severity: Medium**

Users could potentially manipulate their score by directly modifying state variables or interfering with the score calculation logic:

```javascript
// Example exploit code
const tetrisRoot = document.querySelector('.tetris');
const component = Object.values(tetrisRoot)[0];
component.stateNode.setState({score: 999999});
```

## Implemented Anti-Cheat Measures

We've implemented a multi-layered approach to detect and respond to cheating:

### 1. Function Integrity Verification

- **Hash-based Function Validation**: The original `randomTetromino` function is stored and hashed on initialization. This hash is periodically compared with the current function to detect if it has been overridden.

```javascript
const hashFunction = (fn) => {
  try {
    const fnStr = originalToString.call(fn);
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < fnStr.length; i++) {
      const char = fnStr.charCodeAt(i);
      hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char;
      hash = hash & hash; // Convert to 32bit integer
    }
    return hash;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error("Error hashing function:", e);
    return null;
  }
};
```

### 2. Statistical Anomaly Detection

- **Piece Distribution Analysis**: The system tracks the distribution of tetromino pieces and flags suspicious patterns (e.g., if more than 50% of pieces are I-pieces):

```javascript
// Keep only the last 50 pieces for analysis
pieceSequence.push(piece);
if (pieceSequence.length > 50) {
  pieceSequence.shift();
}

// Check for I-piece cheating (over 50% I-pieces)
const pieceCount = pieceSequence.length;
if (pieceCount >= 20) { // Only check with enough data
  const iCount = pieceSequence.filter(p => p === 'I').length;
  const iRatio = iCount / pieceCount;
  
  if (iRatio > 0.5) { // More than 50% I-pieces is suspicious
    console.warn("Potential I-piece cheating detected. Ratio:", iRatio);
    iCheatDetected = true;
    return true;
  }
}
```

### 3. Time-based Anomaly Detection

- **Drop Time Monitoring**: The game tracks the original drop time and establishes valid ranges. If the drop time is manipulated outside these ranges, it's flagged as cheating:

```javascript
// Check if dropTime is manipulated
if (dropTime < validDropTimeRangeRef.current.min) {
  console.warn('Anti-cheat: Game speed manipulation detected. Speed too fast:', dropTime);
  document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('tetris_cheat_detected', { 
    detail: { type: 'speed_manipulation', dropTime }
  }));
}
```

### 4. Event-based Cheat Response System

- **Custom Events**: The game uses a custom event system to trigger appropriate responses when cheating is detected:

```javascript
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('tetris_cheat_detected', { 
  detail: { type: 'function_tampering' } 
}));
```

- **Listener Interface**: A dedicated event listener handles detected cheating events:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('tetris_cheat_detected', handleCheatDetected);
```

### 5. Leaderboard Protection

- **Score Submission Blocking**: When cheating is detected, score submission to the leaderboard is blocked:

```javascript
// Don't submit scores if cheating detected
if (cheatDetected) {
  console.warn('Score submission blocked due to cheat detection');
  return;
}
```

### 6. User Notification System

- **Warning Modals**: When cheating is detected, users are informed through a warning modal that explains their score will not be submitted:

```javascript
<Modal
  isOpen={showCheatWarning && !showNameModal}
  type="warning"
  title="Cheating Detected"
  message="Game manipulation has been detected. Your score will not be submitted to the leaderboard."
  onClose={() => setShowCheatWarning(false)}
/>
```

## Recommendations for Further Enhancement

1. **Server-side Verification**: Implement server-side verification of game mechanics and score calculations to further reduce client-side manipulation risk.

2. **Game State Encryption**: Encrypt critical game state variables to make them harder to identify and manipulate.

3. **Session Replay Analysis**: Store game actions and verify the legitimacy of high scores by replaying the session on the server.

4. **Device Fingerprinting**: Implement device fingerprinting to track and potentially ban repeated cheaters.

5. **Obfuscation**: Apply code obfuscation techniques to make it harder for users to understand and manipulate the game code.

## Conclusion

The implemented anti-cheat measures provide a robust defense against common cheating methods in browser-based games. The multi-layered approach ensures that even if one protection mechanism is bypassed, others can still detect and respond to cheating attempts.

These measures significantly improve the integrity of the game and leaderboard, ensuring a fair experience for all players while minimizing false positives that might impact legitimate players.
