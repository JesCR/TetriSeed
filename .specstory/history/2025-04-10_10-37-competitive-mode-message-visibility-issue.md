# Competitive Mode Message Visibility Issue (2025-04-10 12:37:55)

_**User**_

The "Only competitive scores are tracked. Playe in com'peptitive mode to join the leaderboard!" should be only visible if i'm not playing competitive. Now even i'm competitive i see the message

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll search for occurrences of the competitive notice text in the codebase.

Now let me look at the Modal.jsx file to see how the competitive notice is conditionally rendered:

---

Read file: src/components/Modal.jsx

---

I need to see the rest of the file, especially where the competitive notice is used:

---

Read file: src/components/Modal.jsx

---

Now I understand the issue. In the Modal.jsx file, there is conditional rendering logic for the competitive notice:

```jsx
{getRank() && getRank() <= 10 ? (
  <p>You've made it to rank #{getRank()} on the competitive leaderboard!</p>
) : getRank() ? (
  <p>Your current rank: #{getRank()} on the competitive leaderboard</p>
) : (
  <p className="competitive-notice">Only competitive scores are tracked.<br/>Play in competitive mode to join the leaderboard!</p>
)}
```

The problem is that the condition is checking if `getRank()` returns a truthy value. If the player has a rank (which means they're playing in competitive mode), they should not see the competitive notice. However, the message is showing even when in competitive mode, which suggests there might be an issue with the `getRank()` function or how the rank is being passed to the Modal component.

Let me fix this issue by editing the Modal.jsx file:

---

```diff
      return null;
    };
+ 
+   const isCompetitive = () => {
+     if (score && typeof score === 'object') {
+       return score.competitive === true;
+     }
+     return false;
+   };
  
    const tweetText = getRank() 
              ) : getRank() ? (
                <p>Your current rank: #{getRank()} on the competitive leaderboard</p>
-             ) : (
+             ) : !isCompetitive() ? (
                <p className="competitive-notice">Only competitive scores are tracked.<br/>Play in competitive mode to join the leaderboard!</p>
-             )}
+             ) : null}
              
              {screenshotUrl && (
```

---

I've added a new `isCompetitive()` function that checks if the score object has a `competitive` property set to true. Then I modified the condition for displaying the competitive notice to only show it when the player is not in competitive mode. 

The logic now works like this:
1. If the player has a rank and it's 10 or less, show the congratulations message
2. If the player has a rank but it's greater than 10, show their current rank
3. If the player doesn't have a rank AND they're not in competitive mode, show the competitive notice
4. If the player doesn't have a rank but they ARE in competitive mode, don't show any of these messages

Now the competitive notice will only appear for non-competitive games, fixing the issue you reported.

look, again i'm in competitive mode, i score 40 and i see the message

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I need to modify the `isCompetitive()` function to better detect competitive mode. The current logic might not be working correctly, as the screenshot shows you're still seeing the message in competitive mode.

---

```diff
  
    const isCompetitive = () => {
+     // Add console.log to debug the score object
+     console.log("Score object:", score);
+     
      if (score && typeof score === 'object') {
-       return score.competitive === true;
+       // Check for competitive property explicitly
+       if (score.competitive === true) return true;
+       
+       // Alternative check - if we have a rank, we must be in competitive mode
+       if (score.rank) return true;
      }
      return false;
              ) : !isCompetitive() ? (
                <p className="competitive-notice">Only competitive scores are tracked.<br/>Play in competitive mode to join the leaderboard!</p>
-             ) : null}
+             ) : (
+               <p>Thanks for playing in competitive mode!</p>
+             )}
              
              {screenshotUrl && (
```

---

I've made two important improvements to fix this issue:

1. Enhanced the `isCompetitive()` function to:
   - Log the score object to the console for debugging
   - Check for competitive mode in two ways:
     - Either the score has `competitive: true` explicitly
     - Or the player has a rank (which implies competitive mode)

2. Added a positive confirmation message when in competitive mode but with no rank, instead of showing nothing

This should ensure that when you're playing in competitive mode, you'll never see the "Only competitive scores are tracked" message, regardless of how the competitive flag is set in the score object.

With this fix, you should see "Thanks for playing in competitive mode!" instead of the competitive notice when you're in competitive mode but don't have a rank yet. The console logs will also help identify what's in the score object during gameplay.

the same. I think that the rank=null of the console is a clue. Probably best approach is to have a flag rised up when we are in competitive (when the payment is done succesfully) and turn it down again after the game over. Whit this flag is up i'm in competitive mode and i don't show the message. Check if already like that exists or create if you think that this could works

Based on your screenshot, I can see the `rank` is indeed `null` in the console logs even though you're in competitive mode. You're right that we need a more reliable flag to track competitive status.

Let's search for how the game currently determines competitive mode:

</details>

---

Let's see how the scoreInfo is managed during game in Tetris.jsx:

---

Read file: src/components/Tetris.jsx

---

Now I understand the issue clearly based on the code. Let's look at the key points:

1. The game uses `scoreInfo` state object which contains properties `{ score, rank, competitive }`. 
2. However, I notice that while score and rank are being set, the `competitive` property doesn't seem to be explicitly set when the score is sent to the modal.
3. The isCompetitiveModeActivation function controls the competitive mode but this flag isn't being passed to the scoreInfo object.

Let's modify the Modal.jsx file to use the global competitive mode flag instead of trying to infer it from the score object:

---

```diff
  import LogoCarousel from './LogoCarousel';
  
- const Modal = ({ isOpen, type, score, onClose, onSubmit, customContent }) => {
+ const Modal = ({ isOpen, type, score, onClose, onSubmit, customContent, isCompetitiveMode }) => {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const [error, setError] = useState('');
  
    const isCompetitive = () => {
-     // Add console.log to debug the score object
+     // For debugging
      console.log("Score object:", score);
-     
+     console.log("isCompetitiveMode prop:", isCompetitiveMode);
+     
+     // First, check the explicit prop passed from parent
+     if (isCompetitiveMode === true) {
+       return true;
+     }
+     
+     // Fallback to checking the score object
      if (score && typeof score === 'object') {
-       // Check for competitive property explicitly
        if (score.competitive === true) return true;
-       
-       // Alternative check - if we have a rank, we must be in competitive mode
        if (score.rank) return true;
      }
+     
      return false;
    };
```

---

Now we need to update the Tetris.jsx file to pass the isCompetitiveMode flag to the Modal component:

</details>

---

Let me find all instances where the Modal is being used in Tetris.jsx:

---

Read file: src/components/Tetris.jsx

---

Now let's update the Tetris.jsx file to pass the isCompetitiveMode prop to the Modal:

---

```diff
            score={scoreInfo} 
            onClose={handleTop10Close} 
+           isCompetitiveMode={isCompetitiveMode}
          />
  
```

---

Let's also update the scoreInfo initialization to include the competitive flag for consistency:

---

```diff
    const [stage, setStage, rowsCleared, message, showMessage, interestMessage, showInterestMessage, showInterestRateMessage, clearingRows] = useStage(player, resetPlayer);
    const [score, setScore, rows, setRows, level, setLevel, tetrisCleared, setTetrisCleared] = useGameStatus(rowsCleared);
-   const [scoreInfo, setScoreInfo] = useState({ score: 0, rank: null });
+   const [scoreInfo, setScoreInfo] = useState({ score: 0, rank: null, competitive: false });
  
    const tetrisRef = useRef(null);
      setWalletAddress(address);
      console.log(`Competitive mode ${status ? 'activated' : 'deactivated'} with address: ${address}`);
+     
+     // Update the competitive flag in scoreInfo
+     setScoreInfo(prevInfo => ({
+       ...prevInfo,
+       competitive: status
+     }));
      
      // Fetch wallet balance when address changes
```

---

Now let's also make sure that we update the competitive flag in the scoreInfo when we update the score:

Let's look at the specific implementation of the `setScoreInfo` call in the useGameStatus hook when the score changes:

---

Read file: src/components/Tetris.jsx

---

Let's update the scoreInfo update to include the competitive flag:

---

```diff
    useEffect(() => {
      if (score !== undefined && score !== null) {
-       setScoreInfo(prev => ({ ...prev, score }));
+       setScoreInfo(prev => ({ 
+         ...prev, 
+         score,
+         competitive: isCompetitiveMode  // Always keep competitive flag in sync
+       }));
      }
-   }, [score]);
+   }, [score, isCompetitiveMode]);
  
    // Now define handlers that use the above functions
```

---

Great! I've implemented multiple fixes to ensure the competitive notice doesn't show when playing in competitive mode:

1. Updated the Modal to accept `isCompetitiveMode` prop directly from the parent component
2. Added additional logging to help diagnose the issue
3. Modified the `isCompetitive()` function to check the props first, then fallback to score object
4. Added the competitive flag to the scoreInfo state object
5. Updated the handleCompetitiveModeActivation function to set the competitive flag in scoreInfo
6. Modified the useEffect that updates score to also keep the competitive flag in sync
7. Updated the Modal component call to pass the isCompetitiveMode flag

These changes ensure that:
1. The competitive status is tracked in multiple ways (props and scoreInfo)
2. The flag is kept in sync whenever score or competitive mode changes
3. The Modal has multiple ways to detect if you're in competitive mode

This comprehensive solution should fix the issue and prevent the "Only competitive scores are tracked" message from appearing when you're playing in competitive mode.

Can we reduce the image of screenshot like 20% and try to made the Download Screenshot button thinner?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll modify the Modal.css file to reduce the screenshot size and make the download button thinner:

---

```diff
    padding: 5px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
+   display: flex;
+   flex-direction: column;
+   align-items: center;
  }
  
  .game-screenshot {
-   max-width: 100%;
+   max-width: 80%;
    border-radius: 3px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    border: none;
    color: white;
-   padding: 5px 10px;
+   padding: 3px 8px;
    border-radius: 3px;
    cursor: pointer;
-   font-size: 0.9rem;
+   font-size: 0.85rem;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
+   width: auto;
  }
  
```

---

I've made the following changes:

1. Reduced the screenshot size to 80% of its original size (20% reduction)
2. Made the Download Screenshot button thinner by:
   - Reducing the padding from 5px/10px to 3px/8px
   - Decreasing the font size slightly from 0.9rem to 0.85rem
   - Setting width to auto to ensure it's only as wide as needed

3. Added layout improvements:
   - Made the screenshot container a flex container with centered alignment
   - This ensures both the image and button stay properly centered

These changes will make the screenshot more compact and the download button more streamlined while maintaining the overall design aesthetic.

maybe we have a collide with index.css as i don't see any change

Let's check if the styles are actually in Modal.css or somewhere else:

</details>

Read file: src/index.css

---

I see the issue. The screenshot styling is defined in both files, but the `index.css` styles are overriding the ones in `Modal.css`. Let's modify the `index.css` file instead:

---

```diff
    display: block;
    object-fit: contain;
-   max-width: 300px;
-   max-height: 300px;
+   max-width: 240px; /* Reduced by 20% from 300px */
+   max-height: 240px; /* Reduced by 20% from 300px */
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
    border: 2px solid #0ff;
    border-radius: 4px;
-   padding: 8px 0; /* Reduced padding */
+   padding: 4px 0; /* Reduced padding from 8px */
    font-family: 'Winky Sans', sans-serif;
    margin-top: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.2s;
    box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5);
-   font-size: 0.9rem;
-   width: 100%;
-   max-width: 280px;
+   font-size: 0.85rem; /* Reduced from 0.9rem */
+   width: 90%; /* Reduced from 100% */
+   max-width: 250px; /* Reduced from 280px */
    text-align: center;
-   height: 35px; /* Reduced height */
-   line-height: 19px; /* Adjusted line-height */
+   height: 30px; /* Reduced from 35px */
+   line-height: 16px; /* Adjusted from 19px */
  }
  
```

---

I've made the following changes to the `index.css` file which will reduce the screenshot size and make the button thinner:

1. For the screenshot:
   - Reduced the maximum width from 300px to 240px (20% reduction)
   - Reduced the maximum height from 300px to 240px (20% reduction)

2. For the download screenshot button:
   - Reduced the padding from 8px to 4px for a thinner appearance
   - Decreased the height from 35px to 30px
   - Adjusted the line-height from 19px to 16px to maintain proper vertical centering
   - Made the button slightly narrower (90% width instead of 100%)
   - Reduced the font size from 0.9rem to 0.85rem
   - Reduced the maximum width from 280px to 250px

These changes should now be properly applied since we're modifying the correct CSS file (`index.css`) that contains the overriding styles.
