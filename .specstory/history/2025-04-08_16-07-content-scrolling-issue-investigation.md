# Content Scrolling Issue Investigation (2025-04-08 18:07:46)

fix: Sometimes, when playing on desktop and competitive mode, all the content move down and then up again fast, maybe due to the the clear row message, or because the player /season container is bigger than in cusual mode. Because in casual mode it goes ok, the problem is only in competitive.
