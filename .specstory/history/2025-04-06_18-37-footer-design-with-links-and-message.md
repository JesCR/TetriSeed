Now let me see the main files I need to work with to add the footer.

---

Read file: src/components/Tetris.jsx

---

Let me look at the `App.jsx` to see where I should add the footer component:

---

Read file: src/App.jsx

---

Let me look at the `SuperSeedFacts.jsx` component to understand the footer structure:

---

Read file: src/components/SuperSeedFacts.jsx

Now I need to create a footer component that will be added to the App:

Now I'll create a new Footer component:

---

```diff
- 
+ import React from 'react';
+ 
+ const Footer = () => {
+   return (
+     <div className="main-footer">
+       <div className="footer-content">
+         <div className="footer-links">
+           <a href="https://github.com/JesCR/TetriSeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
+             GitHub
+           </a>
+           <a href="https://x.com/xJesCR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
+             Twitter
+           </a>
+           <a href="https://contest.superseed.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
+             Tesla Contest
+           </a>
+         </div>
+         <div className="footer-love">
+           Made with <span className="heart">❤️</span> for SuperSeed community
+         </div>
+       </div>
+     </div>
+   );
+ };
+ 
+ export default Footer; 
```

---

Now I'll add the CSS styles for the footer:

---

```diff
    animation: flash 0.5s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
  }
+ 
+ /* Main Footer styles */
+ .main-footer {
+   width: 100%;
+   padding: 15px 10px;
+   background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
+   border-top: 2px solid #0ff;
+   margin-top: 20px;
+   box-shadow: 0 -5px 15px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.2);
+ }
+ 
+ .footer-content {
+   max-width: 900px;
+   margin: 0 auto;
+   display: flex;
+   flex-direction: column;
+   align-items: center;
+   gap: 10px;
+ }
+ 
+ .footer-links {
+   display: flex;
+   justify-content: center;
+   flex-wrap: wrap;
+   gap: 20px;
+ }
+ 
+ .footer-links a {
+   color: #0ff;
+   text-decoration: none;
+   font-size: 0.9rem;
+   transition: all 0.3s;
+   padding: 3px 8px;
+   border-radius: 4px;
+   background: rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.1);
+ }
+ 
+ .footer-links a:hover {
+   color: #ffdd00;
+   background: rgba(255, 221, 0, 0.1);
+   transform: translateY(-2px);
+   box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3);
+ }
+ 
+ .footer-love {
+   font-size: 0.85rem;
+   color: #fff;
+   margin-top: 5px;
+   text-align: center;
+ }
+ 
+ .heart {
+   color: #ff3333;
+   font-size: 1.1rem;
+   display: inline-block;
+   animation: heartbeat 1.5s ease infinite;
+ }
+ 
+ @keyframes heartbeat {
+   0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
+   25% { transform: scale(1.1); }
+   50% { transform: scale(1); }
+   75% { transform: scale(1.1); }
+ }
+ 
+ /* Responsive footer styles */
+ @media (max-width: 768px) {
+   .main-footer {
+     padding: 10px 5px;
+     margin-top: 10px;
+   }
+   
+   .footer-links {
+     gap: 12px;
+   }
+   
+   .footer-links a {
+     font-size: 0.8rem;
+   }
+   
+   .footer-love {
+     font-size: 0.75rem;
+   }
+ }
  
```

---

Now I'll update the App.jsx to include the Footer component:

---

```diff
  import Tetris from './components/Tetris';
+ import Footer from './components/Footer';
  import './App.css';
  
      <div className="App">
        <Tetris />
+       <Footer />
      </div>
    );
```

---

Let's run the app to verify everything works:

---

Cancelled

---

I've successfully created and integrated a footer component with links to:
- GitHub project repository
- Your Twitter profile
- Tesla Contest page

The footer also includes the "Made with love for SuperSeed community" message with a beating red heart animation.

Features of the implemented footer:
1. Clean design with a dark semi-transparent background and cyan border
2. Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
3. Interactive link effects with hover animations
4. Beating heart animation for the "Made with love" message
5. Consistent styling with the rest of the application

The footer will appear at the bottom of the application, below all game content, providing a professional finish to your game while also giving credit to your work and linking to relevant resources.

How can i reduce the free space between the content and the botton? there is free space above the content and below it, and i have to scroll down to see the footer

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you reduce the space between the content and the footer. Let's adjust the CSS for the main-footer component.

---

```diff
  .App {
    width: 100%;
+   display: flex;
+   flex-direction: column;
+   min-height: 100vh;
+   justify-content: space-between;
  }
  
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 10px;
-   padding-bottom: 50px;
+   padding-bottom: 20px; /* Reduced from 50px */
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  .main-footer {
    width: 100%;
-   padding: 15px 10px;
+   padding: 10px 5px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
    border-top: 2px solid #0ff;
-   margin-top: 20px;
+   margin-top: 0; /* Reduced from 20px to 0 */
    box-shadow: 0 -5px 15px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.2);
  }
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    .main-footer {
-     padding: 10px 5px;
-     margin-top: 10px;
+     padding: 8px 5px;
+     margin-top: 0;
+   }
+   
+   .tetris {
+     padding-bottom: 10px; /* Even smaller on mobile */
    }
    
```

---

The changes I've made will reduce the space between the content and the footer and ensure the footer is visible without needing to scroll:

1. Set `margin-top: 0` on the main-footer to eliminate unnecessary space
2. Made the App component a flex container with `min-height: 100vh` and `justify-content: space-between` to:
   - Make the App take the full viewport height
   - Push the footer to the bottom
   - Keep content and footer properly spaced

3. Reduced padding at the bottom of the tetris container from 50px to 20px
4. Added mobile-specific adjustments to further reduce spacing on smaller screens

These changes will make the layout more compact and ensure the footer is visible immediately without scrolling, while maintaining the overall design aesthetic of your game.

it doesn't work, this is what i see just after load the page

I see the issue - the footer isn't showing at the bottom of the screen. Let's modify the CSS to fix this positioning problem.

---

```diff
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
+   padding-bottom: 60px; /* Add padding to prevent content from being hidden behind footer */
    background-color: #000000;
    color: #fff;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
-   min-height: 100vh;
+   min-height: calc(100vh - 60px); /* Account for fixed footer */
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
    border-top: 2px solid #0ff;
-   margin-top: 0; /* Reduced from 20px to 0 */
+   margin-top: 0;
    box-shadow: 0 -5px 15px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.2);
+   position: fixed;
+   bottom: 0;
+   left: 0;
+   z-index: 100;
  }
  
```

---

That should fix the footer positioning. I've made the following changes:

1. Added `position: fixed`, `bottom: 0`, and `left: 0` to the footer to stick it to the bottom of the viewport
2. Added `z-index: 100` to make sure the footer appears above other elements
3. Added `padding-bottom: 60px` to the body to prevent content from being hidden behind the fixed footer
4. Adjusted the App's min-height calculation to account for the fixed footer

These changes will ensure that:
- The footer is always visible at the bottom of the screen without scrolling
- The content won't be hidden behind the footer
- The layout remains clean and consistent

Is this what you were looking for?

ok now, can we made disapear tbe line btween footer and content? to have continuity between both of them

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove the border-top from the footer to create visual continuity with the content area.

---

```diff
    padding: 10px 5px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
-   border-top: 2px solid #0ff;
+   border-top: none; /* Removed the border */
    margin-top: 0;
-   box-shadow: 0 -5px 15px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.2);
+   box-shadow: none; /* Removed the box shadow as well for better continuity */
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 0;
```

---

Perfect! I've made the following changes to create visual continuity between the content and footer:

1. Removed the border-top (`border-top: none`) that was previously creating a cyan line separating the footer from the content
2. Removed the box shadow (`box-shadow: none`) that was creating a subtle glow effect above the footer

Now the footer will blend seamlessly with the black background of the main content area, creating a unified visual experience without the dividing line.

The footer now appears as a natural extension of the content area while still maintaining its fixed position at the bottom of the viewport.

i want to add "Check it out: tetriseed.xyz" to the end of the twitter score message when game ends. And maybe can we add a screenshot of the content in the screen?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you add the tetriseed.xyz URL to the Twitter message and investigate the screenshot option.

---

Read file: src/components/Modal.jsx

---

Now I'll modify the Twitter message to include "Check it out: tetriseed.xyz" at the end:

---

```diff
  
    const tweetText = getRank() 
-     ? `I just scored ${getScoreValue()} in TetriSeed: Clear your Debt! Ranked #${getRank()} on the leaderboard! @SuperseedXYZ is the best DeFi protocol for loans! #SuperSeed #ClearYourDebt` 
-     : `I just scored ${getScoreValue()} in TetriSeed: Clear your Debt! @SuperseedXYZ is the best DeFi protocol for loans! #SuperSeed #ClearYourDebt`;
+     ? `I just scored ${getScoreValue()} in TetriSeed: Clear your Debt! Ranked #${getRank()} on the leaderboard! @SuperseedXYZ is the best DeFi protocol for loans! #SuperSeed #ClearYourDebt Check it out: tetriseed.xyz` 
+     : `I just scored ${getScoreValue()} in TetriSeed: Clear your Debt! @SuperseedXYZ is the best DeFi protocol for loans! #SuperSeed #ClearYourDebt Check it out: tetriseed.xyz`;
    const tweetUrl = `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=${encodeURIComponent(tweetText)}`;
  
```

---

Now let's explore how to include a screenshot in the tweet. We'll need to add functionality to capture the game state and include it in the tweet.
