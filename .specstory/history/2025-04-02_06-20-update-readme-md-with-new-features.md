Now I'll update the README.md file with the information about the game modes, MetaMask integration, and other new features:

---

```diff
  - **Debt-themed mechanics**: Clear rows to reduce your debt
  - **Increasing interest rates** as you level up
+ - **Two Game Modes**: Casual and Competitive
+ - **MetaMask Wallet Integration** for competitive gameplay
+ - **Seasonal Competitions** with weekly prize pools
+ - **Prize Distribution System** for top players
  - **Global Leaderboard** to compete with other players
  - **Mobile touch support** for playing on the go
  Make sure:
  1. The server is running
- 2. The `public/data` directory exists and is writable
- 3. Check for errors in the browser console or server logs
- 
- ## 👥 Contributing

- 
- ## 🚀 Deployment
- 
- ### Deploying to Netlify
- 
- TetriSeed can be easily deployed to Netlify for free hosting:
- 
- 1. Build the production version:
-    ```bash
-    npm run build
-    ```
- 
- 2. Deploy using one of these methods:
- 
-    **Method 1: Direct upload** (Quick testing)
-    - Go to [Netlify's dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
-    - Sign up or log in
-    - Drag and drop the `dist` folder to the upload area
-    - Netlify will deploy your site and provide a URL
- 
-    **Method 2: Connect to Git repository** (Continuous deployment)
-    - Create a new site in Netlify
-    - Connect your GitHub repository
-    - Set build command to `npm run build`
-    - Set publish directory to `dist`
-    - Deploy the site
- 
- ### Setting Up the Backend Server
- 
- For the leaderboard functionality to work, you'll need to deploy the server component:
- 
- 1. Deploy the server to a platform like [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- 
- 2. Update the server URL in the API configuration:
-    - Open `src/utils/apiConfig.js`
-    - Replace the placeholder URL with your actual deployed server URL:
-      ```javascript
-      const API_URL = {
-        development: '', // Empty for development (uses proxy)
-        production: 'https://your-actual-server-url.com' // ← Update this
-      };
-      ```
- 
- 3. Rebuild and redeploy the frontend after updating the API URL.
- 
- ### Testing Deployed API Endpoints
- 
- After deployment, you can test that your API endpoints are working:
- 
- 1. Visit your deployed frontend URL
- 2. Open the browser's developer tools (F12)
- 3. Check the Network tab when the game loads
- 4. Verify that requests to `/api/leaderboard` are successfully connecting to your server
- 
- If there are issues with CORS, ensure your server is properly configured to accept requests from your Netlify domain.

It seems the edit wasn't applied correctly. Let me try again with a more focused edit.

---

Read file: README.md

---

I see the changes were actually applied correctly in the Features section. Let me update the Game Controls section to include information about the game modes.

---

```diff
  - **Swipe Down**: Soft drop tetromino
  - **Swipe Up / Tap**: Rotate tetromino
+ 
+ ### Game Modes
+ 
+ - **Casual Mode**: Play freely without any wallet connection
+ - **Competitive Mode**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to enter competitive mode, pay 1 $SUPR per game, and compete for weekly prizes
+ 
+ ## 🏆 Competitive Mode
+ 
+ TetriSeed features a competitive mode where players can compete for real rewards:
+ 
+ - Players pay 1 $SUPR token per game to enter competitive mode
+ - All entry fees are collected in a smart contract prize pool
+ - Each season lasts one week (Monday to Sunday)
+ - At the end of each season, prizes are distributed to the top 5 players:
+   - 1st place: 50% of the prize pool
+   - 2nd place: 30% of the prize pool
+   - 3rd place: 10% of the prize pool
+   - 4th place: 5% of the prize pool
+   - 5th place: 5% of the prize pool
+ - After each season, the leaderboard is reset for a new competition
