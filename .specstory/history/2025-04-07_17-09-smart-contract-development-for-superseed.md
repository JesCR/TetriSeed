Superseed is designed to be EVM equivalent, reusing Ethereum code and mimicking its behavior. However, transaction fees on Superseed will have small differences Ethereum for several reasons. This guide details how transaction fees work on Superseed, helping you account for them in your applications.

L2 Execution Fee
This fee is identical to the one on Ethereum. It’s calculated as the gas used by the transaction multiplied by the gas price. Superseed employs the EIP-1559 mechanism to set the base fee and an optional priority fee.

Base Fee
The base fee is the minimum price per gas unit that must be paid for a transaction to be included in a block. Transactions must specify a maximum base fee higher than the block base fee to be included. The actual fee charged is the block base fee, even if the transaction specifies a higher maximum base fee.

Priority Fee
Transactions can optionally specify a priority fee, an additional price per gas unit paid on top of the base fee. The Superseed sequencer prioritizes transactions with higher priority fees, executing them faster.

L1 Data Fee
This fee covers the cost of publishing transaction data to Ethereum, ensuring its availability for node download and execution. This fee is mainly determined by Ethereum's base fee and, post-Ecotone upgrade, the Ethereum blob data gas price.

The L1 Data Fee is automatically charged and deducted from the sender’s address. It’s influenced by the estimated transaction size, the current Ethereum gas price, and several parameters. /// also: Differences between Ethereum and OP Stack Chains
OP Stack chains are designed to be EVM equivalent and introduces as few changes as possible to the Ethereum protocol. However, there are some minor differences between the behavior of Ethereum and OP Stack chains that developers should be aware of.

Bridging
Bridging - Deposit Transactions
Deposit transactions don't exist on L1s, and are how transactions on an L2 can be initiated from the L1. Importantly, this is how bridge applications can get L1 ETH or tokens into an L2 OP Stack chain. You can read more on deposit transactions here.

Bridging - Withdrawal Transactions and Fault Proofs
Withdrawal transactions are how the state of the L2 rollup can be proven to the L1. Often this involves users withdrawing tokens or ETH to the L1. Fault proofs are the mechanism by which withdrawal transactions are currently proven to the L1. You can read more about fault proofs here.

Opcodes
Opcode	Solidity Equivalent	Behavior
COINBASE	block.coinbase	Returns the address of the current Sequencer's fee wallet. Effectively the same as Ethereum with the caveat that the value typically does not change from block to block.
PREVRANDAO	block.prevrandao	Returns the PREVRANDAO (the most recent RANDAO) value of L1 at the current L1 origin block.
ORIGIN	tx.origin	If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction triggered by a smart contract on L1, then tx.origin is set to the aliased address of the address that triggered the L1 ⇒ L2 transaction. Otherwise, this opcode behaves normally.
CALLER	msg.sender	If the transaction is an L1 ⇒ L2 transaction triggered by a smart contract on L1, and this is the first call frame (rather than an internal transaction from one contract to another), the same address aliasing behavior applies.
Address aliasing
Address aliasing is an important security feature that impacts the behavior of transactions sent from L1 to L2 by smart contracts. Make sure to read this section carefully if you are working with cross-chain transactions. Note that the CrossChainMessenger contracts will handle address aliasing internally on your behalf.

When transactions are sent from L1 to L2 by an Externally Owned Account, the address of the sender of the transaction on L2 will be set to the address of the sender of the transaction on L1. However, the address of the sender of a transaction on L2 will be different if the transaction was triggered by a smart contract on L1.

Because of the behavior of the CREATE opcode, it is possible to create a contract on both L1 and on L2 that share the same address but have different bytecode. Even though these contracts share the same address, they are fundamentally two different smart contracts and cannot be treated as the same contract. As a result, the sender of a transaction sent from L1 to L2 by a smart contract cannot be the address of the smart contract on L1 or the smart contract on L1 could act as if it were the smart contract on L2 (because the two contracts share the same address).

To prevent this sort of impersonation, the sender of a transaction is slightly modified when a transaction is sent from L1 to L2 by a smart contract. Instead of appearing to be sent from the actual L1 contract address, the L2 transaction appears to be sent from an "aliased" version of the L1 contract address. This aliased address is a constant offset from the actual L1 contract address such that the aliased address will never conflict with any other address on L2 and the original L1 address can easily be recovered from the aliased address.

This change in sender address is only applied to L2 transactions sent by L1 smart contracts. In all other cases, the transaction sender address is set according to the same rules used by Ethereum.

Transaction Source	Sender Address
L2 user (Externally Owned Account)	The user's address (same as in Ethereum)
L1 user (Externally Owned Account)	The user's address (same as in Ethereum)
L1 contract (using OptimismPortal.depositTransaction)	L1_contract_address + 0x1111000000000000000000000000000000001111
Transactions
Transaction fees
Transactions on OP Stack chains must pay for an L1 data fee on top of the standard execution gas fee you would expect on Ethereum. Refer to the guide on OP Stack Transaction Fees for more information.

You can use the JS library viem to estimate the entire transaction gas costs, including the L1 Data Fee.

EIP-1559 parameters
The base fee on OP Stack is, like Ethereum, computed via the EIP-1559 mechanism. The EIP-1559 parameters used by OP Stack differ per chain.

Mempool rules
Unlike Ethereum, OP Stack chains do not have a public mempool. The OP Stack mempool is currently only visible to the Sequencer. The Sequencer executes transactions from the mempool in priority fee order (highest fee first).

Chain Finality
Unlike L1s such as Ethereum, OP Stack chains have Unsafe, Safe, and Finalized Heads which indicate the state of finality for a given L2 block. Fault proofs do not impact the finalization of the L2 rollup, only the finalization of withdrawal transactions to the L1. You can read more about these in the docs glossary.

Mempool rules
Unlike Ethereum, OP Stack chains do not have a public mempool. The OP Stack mempool is currently only visible to the Sequencer. The Sequencer executes transactions from the mempool in priority fee order (highest fee first). 

/// also: The OP Stack maintains a distinct gas limit compared to the Ethereum mainnet. While both chains use the same underlying transaction formats, Optimism's gas limits are tailored for optimal Layer 2 performance and scalability. As a result, transactions on Optimism may behave differently from the mainnet regarding gas usage and fee estimation. For a detailed comparison of gas limits between Optimism and Ethereum, see the Optimism Chain Differences documentation.

Transaction fees on OP Mainnet
OP Mainnet is designed to be EVM equivalent, which means it reuses the same Ethereum code you're already familiar with and behaves as much like Ethereum as possible. However, transaction fees on all Layer 2 systems need to diverge from Ethereum to some extent for a number of reasons. This page provides a detailed look at exactly how transaction fees work on OP Mainnet so you can properly account for them in your application.

OP Mainnet transaction fees are composed of an Execution Gas Fee and an L1 Data Fee. The total cost of a transaction is the sum of these two fees. Continue reading to learn more about exactly how each of these fee components are charged.

Execution gas fee
A transaction's execution gas fee is exactly the same fee that you would pay for the same transaction on Ethereum. This fee is equal to the amount of gas used by the transaction multiplied by the gas price attached to the transaction. Like Ethereum, OP Mainnet uses the EIP-1559 mechanism to set the base fee for transactions. The total price per unit gas that a transaction pays is the sum of the base fee and the optional additional priority fee.

Because OP Mainnet is EVM equivalent, the gas used by a transaction on OP Mainnet is exactly the same as the gas used by the same transaction on Ethereum. If a transaction costs 100,000 gas on Ethereum, it will cost 100,000 gas on OP Mainnet. The only difference is that the gas price on OP Mainnet is much lower than the gas price on Ethereum so you'll end up paying much less in ETH.

For this component of the fee, you can estimate the total cost of a transaction using the same tools you would use to estimate the cost of a transaction on Ethereum. You can read more about how Ethereum's gas fees work over on Ethereum.org.

Base fee
The base fee is the minimum price per unit of gas that a transaction must pay to be included in a block. Transactions must specify a maximum base fee higher than the block base fee to be included. The actual fee charged is the block base fee, even if the transaction specifies a higher maximum base fee.

The OP Mainnet base fee behaves exactly like the Ethereum base fee, with a few small parameter changes to account for the much shorter block times on OP Mainnet. None of these parameters should significantly impact your application, but you can read more about each of these parameters on the OP Mainnet differences page. Read more about the base fee in the Ethereum.org documentation.

Priority fee
Just like on Ethereum, OP Mainnet transactions can specify a priority fee. This priority fee is a price per unit of gas that is paid on top of the base fee. For example, if the block base fee is 1 gwei and the transaction specifies a priority fee of 1 gwei, the total price per unit of gas is 2 gwei. The priority fee (i.e. tip) is an optional component of the execution gas fee and can technically be set to 0. However, while EIP-1559 does not define a minimum priority fee, certain wallets and mempool implementations (like Geth) may enforce a minimum value. For instance, Geth typically defaults to a minimum priority fee of 1 gwei, but this can be configured to other values.

The OP Mainnet sequencer will prioritize transactions with a higher priority fee and execute them before any transactions with a lower priority fee. If transaction speed is important to your application, you may want to set a higher priority fee to ensure that your transaction is included more quickly. The eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas RPC method can be used to estimate a priority fee that will get your transaction included quickly.

L1 data fee
The L1 Data Fee is the only part of the OP Mainnet transaction fee that differs from the Ethereum transaction fee. This fee arises from the fact that the transaction data for all OP Mainnet transactions is published to Ethereum. This guarantees that the transaction data is available for nodes to download and execute. The L1 Data Fee accounts for the cost to publish an OP Mainnet transaction to Ethereum and is primarily determined by the current base fee on Ethereum. After the Ecotone upgrade, OP Stack chains will have the option of posting transactions using blobs. For blob-enabled chains, the current Ethereum blob data gas price will largely determine the L1 data fee.

Mechanism
The L1 Data Fee is automatically charged for any transaction that is included in an OP Mainnet block. This fee is deducted directly from the address that sent the transaction. The exact amount paid depends on the estimated size of the transaction in bytes after compression, the current Ethereum gas price and/or blob gas price, and several small parameters.

The L1 Data Fee is most heavily influenced by the Ethereum base fee that is continuously and trustlessly relayed from Ethereum to OP Mainnet. With the Ecotone upgrade, the Ethereum blob base fee also gets relayed to OP Mainnet, and will become the most important factor for chains configured to use blobs instead of base fee. The base fee and blob base fee are updated on OP Mainnet for every Ethereum block, and each fluctuates at most by 12.5% between updates. As a result, short-term fluctuations of the L1 Data Fee are generally quite small and should not impact the average transaction.

The L1 Data Fee is charged automatically. It is currently not possible to limit the maximum L1 Data Fee that a transaction is willing to pay. This is the result of limitations in existing Ethereum transaction formats and tradeoffs that the OP Stack makes to retain better EVM equivalence. Work is underway to improve this situation with the introduction of a new standardized transaction type. For now, you should be aware that the L1 Data Fee can fluctuate with the Ethereum gas price.

Formula
Bedrock
The L1 Data Fee formula changed with the Ecotone upgrade. Refer to the Network Upgrade Overview for network upgrade activation timestamps for OP Sepolia and OP Mainnet.

Prior to the Ecotone upgrade, the L1 Data Fee is calculated based on the following parameters:

The signed transaction, serialized according to the standard Ethereum transaction RLP encoding.
The current Ethereum base fee (trustlessly relayed from Ethereum).
A fixed overhead cost for publishing a transaction (currently set to 188 gas).
A dynamic overhead cost which scales with the size of the transaction (currently set to 0.684).
The L1 Data Fee calculation first begins with counting the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes in the transaction data. Each zero byte costs 4 gas and each non-zero byte costs 16 gas. This is the same way that Ethereum calculates the gas cost of transaction data.

tx_data_gas = count_zero_bytes(tx_data) * 4 + count_non_zero_bytes(tx_data) * 16

After calculating the gas cost of the transaction data, the fixed and dynamic overhead values are applied.

tx_total_gas = (tx_data_gas + fixed_overhead) * dynamic_overhead

Finally, the total L1 Data Fee is calculated by multiplying the total gas cost by the current Ethereum base fee.

l1_data_fee = tx_total_gas * ethereum_base_fee

Ecotone
The L1 Data Fee formula changed with the Ecotone upgrade. Refer to the Network Upgrade Overview for network upgrade activation timestamps for OP Sepolia and OP Mainnet.

The pricing function changes with Ecotone upgrade because of the introduction of the option to post transaction batches to the L1 using blobs instead of through L1 calldata. This updated function uses the following parameters:

The signed transaction serialized according to the standard Ethereum transaction RLP encoding.
The current Ethereum base fee and/or blob base fee (trustlessly relayed from Ethereum).
Two new scalar parameters that independently scale the base fee and blob base fee.
At the exact point of the Ecotone upgrade, the dynamic overhead parameter value is used to initialize the Ecotone base fee scalar, and blob base fee is set to 0. The overhead parameter from the previous function becomes ignored.

The Ecotone L1 Data Fee calculation begins with counting the number of zero bytes and non-zero bytes in the transaction data. Each zero byte costs 4 gas and each non-zero byte costs 16 gas. This value, when divided by 16, can be thought of as a rough estimate of the size of the transaction data after compression.

tx_compressed_size = [(count_zero_bytes(tx_data)*4 + count_non_zero_bytes(tx_data)*16)] / 16

Next, the two scalars are applied to the base fee and blob base fee parameters to compute a weighted gas price multiplier.

weighted_gas_price = 16*base_fee_scalar*base_fee + blob_base_fee_scalar*blob_base_fee

The L1 data fee is then:

l1_data_fee = tx_compressed_size * weighted_gas_price

Recall that base_fee_scalar is set to dynamic_overhead and blob_base_fee_scalar is 0 immediately following the upgrade. Because the old overhead parameter becomes ignored, new L1 data prices will be (slightly, since overhead is typically very small) lower than before the fork. Chain operators will likely want to retune the parameters appropriately after the fork, particularly if they plan on enabling blobs. Chain operators can use the Ecotone fee parameter calculator to get a better estimate of scalar values to use for your chain.

Fjord
The L1 Data Fee formula changed with the Fjord upgrade. Refer to the Network Upgrade Overview for network upgrade activation timestamps for OP Sepolia and OP Mainnet.

The pricing function changes with the Fjord upgrade because of the FastLZ compression estimator, which more accurately charges for L1 data usage on a per-transaction basis. The updated function uses the following parameters:

The FastLZ-compressed size of the signed transaction.
The current Ethereum base fee and/or blob base fee (trustlessly relayed from Ethereum).
The Fjord L1 Data Fee calculation begins with estimating the transaction size using a linear model over the FastLZ-compressed transaction size.

estimatedSizeScaled = max(minTransactionSize * 1e6, intercept + fastlzCoef*fastlzSize)

The model parameters intercept and fastlzCoef were determined by performing a linear regression analysis over a dataset of previous L2 transactions minimizing the root mean square error against the change in batch size, when compressed with Brotli, over historical OP mainnet data. These parameters are fixed in Fjord. The minTransactionSize, intercept, and fastlzCoef values are scaled by 1e6.

Next, the two chain parameters base fee scalar and blob base fee scalar are used to compute a weighted gas price multiplier.

l1FeeScaled = baseFeeScalar*l1BaseFee*16 + blobFeeScalar*l1BlobBaseFee

Both scalars are scaled by 1e6. The final L1 Data Fee is then

l1Cost = estimatedSizeScaled * l1FeeScaled / 1e12

The new cost function takes into account the compression ratio, so chain operators will need to adjust their baseFeeScalar and blobFeeScalar to account for any previous compression ratios that they encountered on their chains. Chain operators can use the Fjord fee parameter calculator to get a better estimate of scalar values to use for their chain.

Sequencer Fee Vault
The Sequencer Fee Vault collects and holds transaction fees paid to the sequencer during block production on OP Mainnet. These fees cover the cost of posting transaction data to L1, ensuring network sustainability and data availability.

Fee Collection and Distribution
Purpose: The sequencer deposits collected fees into the Sequencer Fee Vault. These fees reimburse the sequencer for gas costs when submitting transaction batches to L1.
Vault Address: The Sequencer Fee Vault is predeployed at the address 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000011 on the OP Mainnet.
Fee Usage: Stored fees are eventually transferred to a designated recipient address (e.g., a treasury or distribution contract).
How it works
Fee Collection: During the processing of transactions, the sequencer collects fees from users as part of their transaction costs. These fees are primarily used to cover the gas expenses of posting transaction data to Ethereum L1.
Storage: Collected fees are deposited into the Sequencer Fee Vault contract.
Distribution: The fees are later distributed to the appropriate recipient, typically covering operational costs like L1 gas fees for data availability.
This system ensures effective fee management, maintaining the security and operation of the Optimism network.

I've made the following key changes to the contract:

1. Removed ERC20 token dependencies and imports
2. Changed the entry fee to 0.0001 ETH (as requested)
3. Modified the constructor to remove token address parameter
4. Updated all token-related functions to handle ETH instead:
   - Changed `enterGame()` to be `payable` and handle ETH transfers
   - Updated `depositTokens()` to `depositEth()` and made it payable
   - Modified `ownerWithdraw()` to use ETH transfers
5. Added a `receive()` function to allow direct ETH deposits
6. Updated all events to reflect ETH instead of tokens
7. Removed the deprecated `distributePrizes()` function since we have `endSeason()`
8. Removed redundant getter functions that were already available through public variables

The contract now:
- Uses native ETH for all transactions
- Has a fixed entry fee of 0.0001 ETH
- Maintains the same prize distribution structure (50%, 30%, 10%, 5%, 5%)
- Keeps the weekly season structure
- Handles ETH deposits and withdrawals safely
- Includes proper error handling for ETH transfers

Would you like me to make any additional changes or adjustments to the contract?

---

_**User**_

we need to deploy the contracts on testnet (as game is running now). what what else shoudl i do to deploy a first version and try it out?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you prepare for deploying the contract to the Superseed Sepolia testnet. Let's go through the necessary steps:

1. First, let's check the deployment script:



---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory contracts/scripts • **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `deploy-superseed.js` |
| 📄 `deploy.js` |

</details>

---

Let me check the deployment script to see if it needs any modifications for our ETH-based contract:



---

Read file: contracts/scripts/deploy-superseed.js

---

Let me check the hardhat configuration:




---

Read file: contracts/hardhat.config.js

---

Based on the files I've reviewed, here's what you need to do to deploy the contract to Superseed Sepolia testnet:

1. First, let's create a new deployment script for our ETH-based contract. I'll create a new file:



---

```diff
- 
+ // We require the Hardhat Runtime Environment explicitly here.
+ const hre = require("hardhat");
+ 
+ async function main() {
+   console.log("Deploying the TetriSeedGame contract to SuperSeed Sepolia testnet...");
+ 
+   // Get the deployer account
+   const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
+   console.log("Deploying with account:", deployer.address);
+ 
+   // Deploy TetriSeedGame
+   const TetriSeedGame = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("TetriSeedGame");
+   console.log("Deploying TetriSeedGame...");
+   const tetriSeedGame = await TetriSeedGame.deploy();
+   await tetriSeedGame.deploymentTransaction().wait();
+   
+   console.log("TetriSeedGame deployed to:", tetriSeedGame.target);
+   console.log("Deployment to SuperSeed Sepolia completed successfully!");
+ }
+ 
+ // Execute the deployment
+ main()
+   .then(() => process.exit(0))
+   .catch((error) => {
+     console.error(error);
+     process.exit(1);
+   }); 
```

---

2. Now, let's update the package.json to add a deployment command:




---

Read file: contracts/package.json

---

Let me update the package.json to add our new deployment command:




---

```diff
      "compile": "hardhat compile",
      "deploy:local": "hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost",
-     "deploy:superseed": "hardhat run scripts/deploy-superseed.js --network superseedSepolia"
+     "deploy:superseed": "hardhat run scripts/deploy-superseed.js --network superseedSepolia",
+     "deploy:eth": "hardhat run scripts/deploy-eth.js --network superseedSepolia"
    },
    "keywords": [],
```

---

Now, here are the steps you need to follow to deploy the contract:

1. Make sure you have a `.env` file in your contracts directory with your private key:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
```

2. Get some test ETH for the Superseed Sepolia testnet. You can get it from the Superseed faucet.

3. Compile the contracts:
```bash
cd contracts
npm run compile
```

4. Deploy the contract:
```bash
npm run deploy:eth
```

The deployment will:
- Deploy the TetriSeedGame contract with 0.0001 ETH entry fee
- Use the default prize distribution (50%, 30%, 10%, 5%, 5%)
- Initialize the first season starting from the current Monday

After deployment, you'll get the contract address which you can use to:
1. Interact with the contract through the Superseed Sepolia explorer
2. Update your frontend to use the new contract address
3. Test the basic functionality:
   - Entering games with 0.0001 ETH
   - Depositing additional ETH
   - Checking season information
   - Testing prize distribution (as owner)

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps or would you like to see any modifications to the deployment process?

---

_**User**_

let's go step by step. Can we go to check point 1, private key, that will be the private key of the owner of the contract right? wher ei can find the .env file? if it doesn't exist create it

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, let's handle the private key setup step by step. The private key will be used to deploy the contract and will become the owner of the contract (since we're using OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract).

First, let's check if the .env file exists:



---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory contracts • **11** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `package.json` |

| 📄 `README.md` |
| 📁 `test` |
| 📁 `contracts` |
| 📄 `.env.example` |
| 📄 `hardhat.config.js` |
| 📁 `artifacts` |
| 📄 `package-lock.json` |
| 📁 `cache` |
| 📁 `node_modules` |

</details>

---

I see there's a `.env.example` file. Let's check its contents to see what we need to include:




---

Read file: contracts/.env.example

---

Now, let's create the actual `.env` file. I'll create it with the necessary structure:




---

```diff
- 
+ # Your private key for deployment
+ # WARNING: Never commit your real private key to source control
+ PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
+ 
+ # Note: We don't need SUPR_TOKEN_ADDRESS anymore since we're using ETH 
```

---

Now, you need to:

1. Get a wallet private key. You can do this by:
   - Creating a new wallet using MetaMask or any other wallet
   - Exporting the private key from your existing wallet (if you have one)

2. Replace `your_wallet_private_key_here` in the `.env` file with your actual private key. The private key should:
   - Start with `0x`
   - Be 64 characters long (excluding the `0x` prefix)
   - Be a valid Ethereum private key

Important Security Notes:
1. Never share your private key with anyone
2. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
3. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
4. Keep a backup of your private key in a secure location
5. Only use a test wallet for development, not your main wallet

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps? For example:
1. Creating a new wallet
2. Setting up MetaMask for Superseed Sepolia
3. Getting test ETH for the wallet
4. Adding `.env` to `.gitignore`

Let me know which part you'd like to proceed with!

---

_**User**_

just be sure to add .env to gitignore, i already add the private key

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add `.env` to the `.gitignore` file. Let me check if it exists first:




---

</details>

---

I see there's a `.gitignore` file. Let me check its contents and add the `.env` entry if it's not already there:




---

Read file: .gitignore

---

Let me add the `.env` entry to the `.gitignore` file:





---

```diff
  server/**/*.csv
  server/season_config.json
+ 
+ # Environment variables
+ .env
+ .env.*
+ !.env.example
  
```

---

I've added the following entries to `.gitignore`:
- `.env` - to ignore the main environment file
- `.env.*` - to ignore any environment-specific files
- `!.env.example` - to keep the example file in version control

This will ensure that:
1. Your private key in `.env` is not committed to the repository
2. The example file remains as a template for other developers
3. Any environment-specific files are also ignored

Now that we have the private key set up and `.env` is properly ignored, we can move on to the next step. Would you like to:
1. Compile the contracts
2. Get test ETH for the wallet
3. Deploy the contract

Let me know which step you'd like to proceed with!

---

_**User**_

i think the deploy was good

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the deployment was successful! Let's break down what happened:

1. The contract was deployed to Superseed Sepolia testnet
2. Deployer address: `0xc984C7Ec3925f0F540efBcbe8E7e20c583921C17`
3. Contract address: `0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42`

Now that the contract is deployed, you can:

1. View the contract on the Superseed Sepolia explorer:
   https://explorer-sepolia-superseed-826s35710w.t.conduit.xyz/address/0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42

2. Update your frontend to use this new contract address. You'll need to:
   - Update the contract address in your frontend configuration
   - Update any contract interaction code to use ETH instead of $SUPR tokens
   - Update the entry fee to 0.0001 ETH

3. Test the basic functionality:
   - Enter a game (costs 0.0001 ETH)
   - Deposit additional ETH
   - Check season information
   - Test prize distribution (as owner)

Would you like me to help you with any of these next steps? For example:
1. Updating the frontend configuration
2. Testing the contract functions
3. Setting up contract verification on the explorer

Let me know what you'd like to focus on next!

---

_**User**_

let's go to: Updating the frontend configuration

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's update the frontend configuration to use the new ETH-based contract. First, I'll check the current frontend setup to see what files we need to modify.

---

Let's examine the web3Utils.js file to see what we need to modify:

---

Read file: src/utils/web3Utils.js

---

Let's continue reading the file to find contract interactions:

---

Read file: src/utils/web3Utils.js

---

Let's keep reading to find any specific code related to the TetriSeed game contract:

---

Read file: src/utils/web3Utils.js

Let's examine the CompetitiveMode.jsx file, which is likely handling the interactions with the TetriSeed contract:

---

Read file: src/components/CompetitiveMode.jsx

---

Let's look at the rest of the file to find the payment handling for the competitive mode:

---

Read file: src/components/CompetitiveMode.jsx

</details>

---

Let's look at the Tetris.jsx file to see how the payment is handled:

---

Read file: src/components/Tetris.jsx

---

Based on my review of the code, I need to create a new file that will handle the contract interactions and update the existing `web3Utils.js` file to use ETH instead of $SUPR. Here's what I'll do:

1. First, let's create a contract integration file:

```

Now, let's update the web3Utils.js file to use our contract integration:



---

```diff
  import { ethers } from 'ethers';
  import { getApiUrl } from './apiConfig';
+ import { enterGame } from './contractUtils';
  
  // Network configuration - Add Sepolia testnet and mainnet configurations
  };
  
- // Mock payment function (to be replaced with real transaction in the future)
+ // Replace the mock payment function with real contract interaction
  export const mockPayCompetitiveFee = async (account) => {
    try {
      }
      
-     // Log the mock payment
-     console.log(`Processing payment of 1 $SUPR from ${account}`);
+     // Log the payment attempt
+     console.log(`Processing payment of 0.0001 ETH from ${account}`);
      
-     // Call the payment API endpoint
-     const response = await fetch(getApiUrl('/api/payment'), {
-       method: 'POST',
-       headers: {
-         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
-       },
-       body: JSON.stringify({ address: account }),
-     });
+     // Use the real contract function
+     const result = await enterGame();
      
-     if (!response.ok) {
-       const errorText = await response.text();
-       console.error('Payment API error:', errorText);
-       throw new Error('Failed to process payment');
+     if (!result.success) {
+       throw new Error(result.error || 'Failed to process payment');
      }
      
-     const data = await response.json();
-     console.log('Payment successful:', data);
+     console.log('Payment successful:', result);
      
      return { 
        success: true, 
-       txHash: data.txHash || `mock_tx_${Date.now()}`,
-       potSize: data.potSize,
-       playerCount: data.playerCount
+       txHash: result.txHash,
+       potSize: result.potSize,
+       playerCount: result.playerCount
      };
    } catch (error) {
```

---

Lastly, let's update the Tetris.jsx file to show the new ETH entry fee instead of $SUPR:



---

```diff
                  <div className="rule-item">
                    <span className="rule-number">1.</span>
-                   <span className="rule-text">All <span className="crypto-amount">$SUPR</span> are collected in a smart contract</span>
+                   <span className="rule-text">All <span className="crypto-amount">ETH</span> are collected in a smart contract</span>
                  </div>
                  <div className="rule-item">
                      ? (isLoading 
                        ? 'Processing Payment...' 
-                       : <span>Pay <span className="crypto-amount">1 $SUPR</span> & Start Game</span>
+                       : <span>Pay <span className="crypto-amount">0.0001 ETH</span> & Start Game</span>
                        ) 
                      : 'Start Game'}
```

---

Great! I've made all the necessary changes to update the frontend configuration to use the ETH-based contract:

1. Created a new `contractUtils.js` file with:
   - TetriSeedGame contract ABI
   - Contract addresses for testnet
   - Functions to interact with the contract (enterGame, depositEth, etc.)
   - Helper functions to get contract data (entry fee, prize pool, etc.)

2. Updated `web3Utils.js` to:
   - Replace the mock payment function with real contract interaction
   - Update the payment message to show 0.0001 ETH instead of 1 $SUPR

3. Updated `Tetris.jsx` to:
   - Update the rules modal to show ETH instead of $SUPR
   - Change the payment button text to show 0.0001 ETH

Now your frontend is configured to use the ETH-based contract. When players enter competitive mode and start a game, they'll pay 0.0001 ETH which will go directly to the contract's prize pool.

To test this functionality:
1. Make sure you have MetaMask installed and connected to the Superseed Sepolia testnet
2. Ensure your wallet has some test ETH
3. Connect your wallet in the game
4. Enter competitive mode and start a game
5. MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction for 0.0001 ETH
6. After confirmation, the game will start in competitive mode

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail?

_**User**_

in the competitive rules, i want to explain that we will send 0.001 eth instead of $supr hile we don't have the real $SUPR token TGE, that the ETH is from testnet with no real value, also in the current season info, in the PRIZE POOL: info, we now should add 4 decimals to see the collected amount, and that amount must come from the endpoint from smart contract balance in eth

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the competitive rules to explain the ETH usage and modify the prize pool display to show 4 decimals. Let's look at the SeasonInfo component first to see how the prize pool is currently displayed:

---

Read file: src/components/SeasonInfo.jsx

---

Now, let's update the SeasonInfo component to show the prize pool in ETH with 4 decimals:

---

```diff
          <div className="stat-label">Prize Pool</div>
          <div className="stat-value">
-           <span className="crypto-amount">{seasonData.potSize} $SUPR</span>
+           <span className="crypto-amount">{parseFloat(seasonData.potSize).toFixed(4)} ETH</span>
          </div>
        </div>
          <div className="stat-label">Prize Pool:</div>
          <div className="stat-value">
-           <span className="crypto-amount">{seasonData.potSize} $SUPR</span>
+           <span className="crypto-amount">{parseFloat(seasonData.potSize).toFixed(4)} ETH</span>
          </div>
        </div>
```

---

Now, let's update the competitive rules in the Tetris component to explain the ETH usage:

---

```diff
                  <div className="rule-item">
                    <span className="rule-number">1.</span>
-                   <span className="rule-text">All <span className="crypto-amount">ETH</span> are collected in a smart contract</span>

                    <span className="rule-number">2.</span>

+                   <span className="rule-text">This is testnet ETH with <strong>no real value</strong> - all transactions are on the Superseed Sepolia testnet</span>
                  </div>

                  </div>
                  <div className="rule-item">

+                   <span className="rule-number">6.</span>
                    <span className="rule-text">After that, a new season starts and the leaderboard is cleared</span>
                  </div>
```

Now let's update the API config to fetch the prize pool from the smart contract instead of the API endpoint. First, let's see how the current API config works:

---

Read file: src/utils/apiConfig.js

---

Now, let's modify the apiConfig.js to fetch the prize pool from our smart contract:

---

```diff
  // Get the current environment
  const env = import.meta.env.MODE || 'development';
+ 
+ // Import the contract utilities for ETH prize pool
+ import { getPrizePool } from './contractUtils';
  
  // Export the base URL for API calls
      
      const data = await response.json();
+     
+     // Fetch prize pool from smart contract
+     try {
+       const prizePoolResult = await getPrizePool();
+       if (prizePoolResult.success) {
+         // Replace API prize pool with contract prize pool
+         data.potSize = prizePoolResult.prizePool;
+       }
+     } catch (contractError) {
+       console.error('Error fetching prize pool from contract:', contractError);
+       // Keep the API value as fallback
+     }
+     
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching current season:', error);
+     // Get prize pool from contract for mock data
+     let mockPotSize = MOCK_CURRENT_SEASON.potSize;
+     
+     try {
+       const prizePoolResult = await getPrizePool();
+       if (prizePoolResult.success) {
+         mockPotSize = prizePoolResult.prizePool;
+       }
+     } catch (contractError) {
+       console.error('Error fetching prize pool from contract for mock data:', contractError);
+     }
+     
      // Return mock data as fallback with calculated remaining time
      console.warn('Using mock season data as fallback');
        return {
          ...MOCK_CURRENT_SEASON,
+         potSize: mockPotSize,
          timeRemaining: { days, hours, minutes }
        };
      } else {
        return {
          ...MOCK_CURRENT_SEASON,
+         potSize: mockPotSize,
          timeRemaining: { days: 0, hours: 0, minutes: 0 }
        };
```

---

Finally, let's also update the PrizeDistribution component to show ETH instead of $SUPR:

---



---

The prize distribution percentages are already generic and don't mention specific tokens, so no changes were needed there.

Here's a summary of all the changes we've made:

1. Updated the SeasonInfo component to:
   - Display prize pool amount with 4 decimal places for better precision with ETH
   - Change the display from "$SUPR" to "ETH"

2. Updated the Competitive Rules Modal to:
   - Add an explanation that we're temporarily using ETH instead of $SUPR until token launch
   - Clearly state that this is testnet ETH with no real value
   - Note that all transactions are on the Superseed Sepolia testnet
   - Reorganize the numbering of rules to accommodate the new explanations

3. Modified the apiConfig.js to:
   - Import the getPrizePool function from contractUtils.js
   - Fetch the prize pool directly from the smart contract
   - Use the contract prize pool value instead of the API value
   - Handle fallbacks properly if contract fetching fails

These changes ensure that:
1. The prize pool displays the actual ETH amount from the smart contract with 4 decimal places
2. Users are clearly informed about the use of testnet ETH instead of $SUPR
3. The application transparently communicates that the testnet ETH has no real value

With these modifications, your application is now ready to use the ETH-based contract for the competitive game mode while properly explaining the temporary use of ETH to your users.
