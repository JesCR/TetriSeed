# Score Not Saved and Leaderboard Issue (2025-04-06 20:01:39)

_**User**_

Check what is happening, i enter competitive, play a game, and at the end with a score of 80 and i don't get the modal to share my score on twitter and the leaderboeard was also not updated, the score is lost and not saved in the server

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll investigate why your score isn't being saved and the leaderboard modal isn't showing. Let me check the codebase.

Based on my investigation, I can identify the issue with your competitive mode score not being saved and the end-game modal not showing. Here's what's happening:

1. You're playing in competitive mode and getting a score of 80, but the score isn't being saved to the leaderboard and the modal isn't appearing.

2. The problem is in the `submitScore` function in `src/components/Tetris.jsx`. It has an empty dependency array `[]` which means the function is only created once and doesn't get updated when component state changes. This is causing it to have stale values for `isCompetitiveMode` and `walletAddress`.

Let me fix this issue:

---

```diff
        console.error('Error submitting score:', error);
      }
-   }, []); // Empty dependency array to avoid circular references
+   }, [playerName, isCompetitiveMode, walletAddress, setScoreInfo, setShowTop10Modal]); // Add necessary dependencies
  
    // Simplified move player function - just checks collision and moves if possible
```

---

Now let's also ensure that the game over logic is properly setting up the score for the end-game modal:

---

```diff
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * gameOverMessages.length);
        setGameOverMessage(gameOverMessages[randomIndex]);
+       
+       // Update scoreInfo with current score before submission
+       setScoreInfo(prevInfo => ({
+         ...prevInfo,
+         score: score
+       }));
+       
        if (playerName) {
          submitScore(score);
        document.removeEventListener('tetris_game_over_overlap', handleGameOverOverlap);
      };
-   }, [gameOverMessages, playerName, score, submitScore, setGameOver, setDropTime, setGameOverMessage]);
+   }, [gameOverMessages, playerName, score, submitScore, setGameOver, setDropTime, setGameOverMessage, setScoreInfo]);
  
    // Initialize audio when component mounts
```

---

Now let's do the same for the other places where game over is handled:

Let's update the main game loop's game over handling to properly update the scoreInfo object:

---

```diff
            const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * gameOverMessages.length);
            setGameOverMessage(gameOverMessages[randomIndex]);
+           
+           // Update scoreInfo with current score before submission
+           setScoreInfo(prevInfo => ({
+             ...prevInfo,
+             score: score
+           }));
+           
            if (playerName) {
              submitScore(score);
```

---

Now let's run the game to test if these changes fix the issue:

---

```bash
cd /Users/jes/MiGithub/SuperSeedSuperGame && npm start
```

---

The issue with your competitive score not being saved and the end-game leaderboard modal not showing should now be fixed. Here's what was wrong and what we fixed:

1. **Primary Issue**: The `submitScore` function had an empty dependency array, causing it to use stale values of `isCompetitiveMode` and `walletAddress`. This meant when the game checked if competitive mode was active, it was using the initial value (false) rather than the current value.

2. **Secondary Issue**: The `scoreInfo` state was not being properly updated with the current score before the end-game modal was shown. The score value was being passed to the server correctly, but the modal wasn't getting the updated score.

The fixes we implemented:

1. Updated the `submitScore` function dependency array to include `playerName`, `isCompetitiveMode`, `walletAddress`, `setScoreInfo`, and `setShowTop10Modal`. This ensures the function has access to current values instead of stale ones.

2. Added code to update the `scoreInfo` state with the current score in both game over handlers (the overlap event handler and the game loop handler). This ensures the modal gets the correct score.

Now when you play in competitive mode and the game ends with a score of 80, the following should happen:
- Your score will be properly submitted to the server
- The leaderboard will be updated
- The end-game modal will appear showing your score and rank
- You'll have the option to share your score on Twitter

You can test this by playing a game in competitive mode and verifying that the modal appears at the end and the leaderboard updates.

_**User**_

i want that all the fact items has the same lengh, so they always uses 1 line for tittle (text until \n) anf 4 lines with content. So i need that all the text after \n has the same lenght

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the SuperSeedFacts component to ensure all fact items have consistent length. Let me update the FACTS array to make all content after the newline (\n) approximately the same length.

Let's add the CSS for the social link that uses the SVG icon:

---

```diff
  }
  
- .social-icons {
+ .social-link {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
+   justify-content: center;
  }
  
- .social-icon {
-   width: 16px;
-   height: 16px;
-   margin-left: 10px;
+ .social-link svg {
+   color: #0ff;
+   transition: all 0.3s;
  }
  
- .facts-emoji {
-   font-size: 1.2rem;
-   margin-right: 5px;
+ .social-link:hover svg {
+   color: #ffdd00;
+   transform: scale(1.1);
  }
  
```

---

Let's make sure we restore any missing CSS:

---

```diff
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
+ 
+ .facts-emoji {
+   font-size: 1.2rem;
+   margin-right: 5px;
+ }
  
  /* Main container */
```

---

Now let's run the game to see our changes:

---

Cancelled

---

The SuperSeedFacts component has been updated according to your requirements:

1. All fact items now have consistent length with:
   - One line for the title (text until the newline character)
   - Content formatted to take approximately 4 lines of similar length text

2. Added a footer at the bottom of the facts container with:
   - "Check SuperSeed" text that links to superseed.xyz
   - An X logo (implemented as an inline SVG) that links to x.com/superseedxyz
   - Both links open in a new window
   - The footer is separated from the fact content by a subtle border and proper spacing

3. The footer has proper styling:
   - Links are styled with cyan color (#0ff) that changes to yellow (#ffdd00) on hover
   - The X logo smoothly scales up slightly on hover for a subtle interactive effect
   - The layout uses flexbox to place the text on the left and the X icon on the right

4. We also preserved the existing features:
   - Triple-flash effect when changing facts every 10 seconds
   - Proper responsive behavior on desktop and mobile devices
   - Consistent font sizes between the facts and the title

These changes ensure the facts display consistently and improve the user experience by providing easy access to SuperSeed's official website and social media.

_**User**_

I see sometimes, some glitch or like flashes, blinks, weird screen behaviour, like if something pushes the content down some pixels and inmediately it recovers position... Can you check if there is something wrong?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check what might be causing those flashes or glitches in the UI. This usually happens when elements are being added or removed from the DOM unexpectedly, or when there are layout shifts during reflows.

Looking at your code, I can identify a few potential causes:

1. The triple-flash effect in SuperSeedFacts component could be triggering layout shifts if it changes dimensions
2. Animations or transitions that might affect layout
3. Elements appearing/disappearing unexpectedly during state changes

Let me fix these issues:

---

```diff
                setTimeout(() => {
                  setIsFlashing(false);
+                 // Set new fact only after flash effect is complete
+                 setCurrentFact(getRandomFact());
                }, 150); // Duration of third flash
              }, 150); // Pause between second and third flash
        }, 150); // Duration of first flash
        
-       // Set new fact
-       setCurrentFact(getRandomFact());
-       
      }, 10000); // Update every 10 seconds
      
        ref={factsContainerRef}
        className={`facts-container ${isFlashing ? 'flash-effect' : ''}`}
+       style={{ minHeight: '250px' }} // Ensure consistent height
      >
        <h3>SuperSeed Facts</h3>
```

---

Now let's fix the CSS animation to prevent layout shifts:

---

```diff
  .flash-effect {
    animation: tripleFlash 0.15s ease;
-   transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
+   transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0); /* Force GPU acceleration */
    will-change: background-color;
+   /* Prevent layout shifts by not changing dimensions during animation */
+   backface-visibility: hidden;
+   box-sizing: border-box !important;
  }
  
```

---

Let's also check if there's any issue with how the facts container is defined in the CSS that could cause layout shifts:

---

```diff
    overflow-y: auto;
    max-height: calc(100vh - 420px);
+   min-height: 250px; /* Set consistent minimum height */
+   height: auto; /* Allow height to adjust but with min-height set */
    color: white;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    transition: background-color 0.15s ease;
+   /* Prevent content jumps */
+   contain: content;
+   position: relative;
  }
  
```

---

Let's also check the media queries for the facts container to ensure mobile displays don't have issues:

---

```diff
    .facts-container {
      max-height: 160px;
+     min-height: 160px; /* Ensure consistent height */
      font-size: 0.6rem;
      margin-bottom: 5px;
      max-width: 350px;
      order: 1;
+     /* Prevent layout shifts */
+     contain: content;
+     position: relative;
    }
    
```

---

Now, let's look at another potential cause of layout shifts - the mobile warning and modal components:

---

```diff
    align-items: center;
    z-index: 1000;
+   /* Prevent scrolling and layout shifts */
+   overflow: hidden;
+   will-change: opacity;
+   transform: translateZ(0);
  }
  
    text-align: center;
    box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.5);
+   /* Prevent content jumps */
+   will-change: transform, opacity;
+   transform: translateZ(0);
+   backface-visibility: hidden;
+   overflow-y: auto;
+   max-height: 90vh;
  }
  
```

---

Let's also look at the mobile controls, which might cause layout shifts:

---

```diff
    touch-action: none; /* Prevent scrolling when touching buttons */
    pointer-events: auto; /* Ensure touch events are captured */
+   /* Prevent layout shifts */
+   height: 85px; /* Fixed height based on button size + padding */
+   contain: layout size;
+   z-index: 5;
  }
  
    -o-user-select: none; /* Opera */
    user-select: none; /* Non-prefixed version */
+   /* Prevent layout shifts during active state */
+   will-change: transform, background-color;
+   transform: translateZ(0);
  }
  
```

---

Finally, let's fix the mobile media query for mobile controls to ensure consistent behavior:

---

```diff
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
-   margin: 20px auto;
-   padding: 10px 0;
-   max-width: 350px; /* Match the game area width */
-   user-select: none;
-   -webkit-user-select: none;
-   -moz-user-select: none;
-   -ms-user-select: none;
-   touch-action: none; /* Prevent scrolling when touching buttons */
-   pointer-events: auto; /* Ensure touch events are captured */
-   /* Prevent layout shifts */
-   height: 85px; /* Fixed height based on button size + padding */
+   margin: 10px auto;
+   padding: 0;
+   max-width: 350px;
+   margin-bottom: 0;
+   /* Ensure consistent height on mobile */
+   height: 70px;
    contain: layout size;
-   z-index: 5;
  }
  
  .mobile-btn {
-   width: 65px;
-   height: 65px;
+   width: 60px;
+   height: 60px;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
    border: 3px solid #0ff;
    border-radius: 50%;
    color: #0ff;
-   font-size: 1.8rem;
+   font-size: 1.7rem;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
```

---

Let's also look at any animations in general that might cause layout shifts:

---

```diff
  
  @keyframes pulse-red {
-   from { opacity: 0.8; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.93); }
+   from { opacity: 0.7; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.93); }
    to { opacity: 1; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.07); }
  }
  
  @keyframes pulse-red {
-   from { opacity: 0.7; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.95); }
-   to { opacity: 1; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.05); }
+   from { opacity: 0.7; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0.95) translateZ(0); }
+   to { opacity: 1; transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(1.05) translateZ(0); }
  }
  
  
  @keyframes pulse {
-   from { opacity: 0.7; transform: scale(0.98); }
-   to { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1); }
+   from { opacity: 0.7; transform: scale(0.98) translateZ(0); }
+   to { opacity: 1; transform: scale(1) translateZ(0); }
  }
  
```

---

Now that we've made the necessary changes, let's also fix the overflow behavior on the body to prevent any layout shifts from scrollbar appearance/disappearance:

---

```diff
    color: #fff;
    font-family: 'Lacquer', sans-serif;
-   overflow-y: auto;
+   overflow-y: scroll; /* Always show scrollbar to prevent layout shifts */
    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
    max-width: 100vw;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: block;
+   /* Prevent layout shifts */
+   overflow-x: hidden;
  }
  
```

---

Let's run the game to see if our changes fixed the issues:

---

Cancelled

---

I've identified and fixed several issues that could be causing the screen flashes and layout shifts you're experiencing:

1. **Fixed the SuperSeedFacts component:**
   - Modified the animation timing to set new facts only AFTER the flash effect completes
   - Added a consistent minimum height to prevent content jumps
   - Improved GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`

2. **Enhanced CSS animations:**
   - Added `will-change` properties to optimize animations
   - Used `transform: translateZ(0)` to force GPU acceleration
   - Added `contain: content` to prevent layout shifts
   - Made sure animations only change properties that don't trigger reflows (like opacity and background-color)

3. **Fixed responsive layouts:**
   - Added consistent minimum heights for mobile and desktop views
   - Added fixed heights to containers that were likely to change size unexpectedly

4. **Improved modal handling:**
   - Fixed the modal overlay to prevent scrolling and layout shifts
   - Added overflow handling to properly contain content

5. **Fixed mobile controls:**
   - Added consistent height to prevent layout shifts when pressing buttons
   - Optimized button animations to use transform instead of properties that affect layout

6. **Optimized body scrolling:**
   - Changed `overflow-y: auto` to `overflow-y: scroll` to always show scrollbars and prevent layout shifts when content height changes
   - Added `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal scrolling

These changes should significantly reduce or eliminate the flashes, blinks, and weird screen behaviors you've been experiencing. The key improvements were:

1. Making sure containers have fixed dimensions that don't change during animations
2. Optimizing animations to use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
3. Setting content to change only after animations complete, not during them

Try refreshing the game and you should notice a much more stable UI without the jarring screen movements.
