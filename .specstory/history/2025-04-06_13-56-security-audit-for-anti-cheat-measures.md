# Security Audit for Anti-Cheat Measures (2025-04-06 15:56:40)

_**User**_

to enhance security in the game play, how can i deploy my client and avoid dev console to see the files and code of the files. Try to block access to dev console or dificult it, also inspect code, view source code etc. (i don't want to ofuscate js for now)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll explore ways to enhance security by restricting access to browser developer tools without JavaScript obfuscation.

Let me look at the main index.html and vite config to understand the build structure:

---

Read file: index.html

---

Read file: vite.config.js

---

Now let me look at the main JavaScript entry point:

---

Read file: src/main.jsx

---

Let me look at the build process to understand how the application is deployed:

---

Read file: package.json

---

Now, let's create a solution to enhance security by restricting developer tools access. I'll create a new JavaScript file that we can include in the main HTML:

---

```diff
- 
+  
```

---

Now let's create a warning page that users will be redirected to if they try to use developer tools:

---

Cancelled
