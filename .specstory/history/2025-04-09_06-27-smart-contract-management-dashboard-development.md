# Smart Contract Management Dashboard Development (2025-04-09 08:27:06)

_**User**_

i have deployed my smart contract: 0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42 with ""hardhat run scripts/deploy-eth.js --network superseedSepolia". But now i want to do a simple management-dashboard for the owner of the contract, so he can check the relevant endpoints, fees, price distribution, price pot, season info etc, and be able to update acording to the endpoints we have (fees, collect funds, distrubute or whatever we have defined in the contract). This dashboard-frontend shoudl secure access only to the delpoyer address (creator) of the smart contract, and the ui/ux should be themed as the tetriseed game page. Can you help me with that?

I'll help you build a management dashboard for your smart contract. Let's first examine your contract to understand its structure and functions.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory contracts/contracts • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `TetriSeedGame.sol` |
| 📄 `ReentrancyAttacker.sol` |
| 📄 `MockSUPR.sol` |

</details>

---

Let's look at the main contract to understand its functions:

---

Read file: contracts/contracts/TetriSeedGame.sol

---

Now, let's look at the hardhat config to understand the network setup:

---

Read file: contracts/hardhat.config.js

---

Let's check the deploy script to understand how the contract was deployed:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory contracts/scripts • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `deploy-eth.js` |
| 📄 `deploy-superseed.js` |
| 📄 `deploy.js` |

</details>

---

Read file: contracts/scripts/deploy-eth.js

---

Now that I understand the contract, let's create a simple dashboard for the contract owner. I'll create a React application that interacts with the deployed contract.

First, let's set up a new directory for the dashboard:

---

```bash
mkdir -p dashboard && cd dashboard && npm init -y
```

```
& npm init -y-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ mkdir -p dashboard && cd dashboard & 
Wrote to /Users/jes/MiGithub/SuperSeedSuperGame/dashboard/package.json:

  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {

  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}

Now let's install the necessary dependencies for our React application with Web3 integration:

---

```bash
npm install react react-dom ethers@6 react-scripts web-vitals web3modal dotenv sass
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:dashboard jes$ npm install react react-dom ethers@6 react-scripts web-vitals web3modal 
dotenv sass

Let's set up the project structure:

---

```bash
mkdir -p public src/components src/styles src/utils src/contracts
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:dashboard jes$

Now, let's create the necessary files for our dashboard application:

---

```diff

Now, let's create the public directory files:

Now, let's create the contract interface:

+   );
+ };
+ 
+ export default Dashboard; 
```

Finally, let's create the main App.js file:

---

```diff
- 
+ import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
+ import Login from './components/Login';
+ import Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';
+ import { getContract, isContractOwner } from './utils/web3';
+ 
+ function App() {
+   const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);
+   const [isAuthorized, setIsAuthorized] = useState(false);
+   const [provider, setProvider] = useState(null);
+   const [signer, setSigner] = useState(null);
+   const [address, setAddress] = useState('');
+   const [authError, setAuthError] = useState('');
+   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
+   
+   const handleLogin = async (providerInstance, signerInstance, userAddress) => {

+     setAuthError('');
+     
+     try {
+       setProvider(providerInstance);

+       setAddress(userAddress);
+       setIsAuthenticated(true);
+

+       const contract = await getContract(signerInstance);
+       const isOwner = await isContractOwner(userAddress, contract);
+       
+       if (isOwner) {

+       } else {

+       }
+     } catch (error) {
+       console.error("Authorization error:", error);
+       setAuthError('Failed to verify authorization. Please try again.');
+     } finally {
+       setLoading(false);
+     }
+   };
+   
+   if (!isAuthenticated) {
+     return <Login onLogin={handleLogin} />;
+   }
+   
+   if (loading) {
+     return (
+       <div className="auth-container">
+         <div className="auth-card">
+           <h2>Verifying Authorization</h2>
+           <div className="loading">Please wait...</div>
+         </div>
+       </div>
+     );
+   }
+   
+   if (!isAuthorized) {
+     return (
+       <div className="auth-container">
+         <div className="auth-card">
+           <h2>Access Denied</h2>
+           <div className="error-message">{authError}</div>

+         </div>
+       </div>
+     );
+   }
+   
+   return <Dashboard signer={signer} address={address} />;
+ }
+ 
+ export default App; 
```

---

Finally, let's create a README.md file to document the dashboard:

---

```diff
- 
+ # TetriSeed Game Admin Dashboard
+ 
+ An admin dashboard for managing the TetriSeed Game smart contract deployed at `0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42` on the SuperSeed Sepolia testnet.
+ 
+ ## Features
+ 
+ - View contract information:
+   - Current entry fee
+   - Prize pool amount
+   - Current season and end time
+   - Prize distribution percentages
+ - Admin operations:
+   - Update entry fee
+   - Update prize distribution percentages
+   - Withdraw funds from the contract
+   - End season and distribute prizes to winners
+ 
+ ## Security
+ 
+ This dashboard is only accessible to the owner/deployer of the TetriSeed Game contract. Authentication is performed using Web3 wallet connection (e.g., MetaMask) and verifying the connected address against the contract owner.
+ 
+ ## Getting Started
+ 
+ 1. Clone this repository
+ 2. Install dependencies:
+    ```
+    npm install
+    ```
+ 3. Start the development server:
+    ```
+    npm start
+    ```
+ 4. Connect your wallet (must be the contract owner address)
+ 
+ ## Built With
+ 
+ - React - Frontend framework
+ - ethers.js - Ethereum library for contract interaction
+ - Web3Modal - Wallet connection library
+ - SCSS - For styling
+ 
+ ## Smart Contract Interface
+ 
+ The dashboard interacts with the TetriSeed Game smart contract through its ABI and provides a user-friendly interface for all owner-only operations. 
```

---

Let's also add a .env.example file to help with configuration:

---

```diff
- 
+ # This file contains environment variables for the TetriSeed Game Dashboard
+ # Create a .env file based on this example
+ 
+ # Network configuration (not required but can be used for customization)
+ REACT_APP_NETWORK_NAME=SuperSeed Sepolia Testnet
+ REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=53302
+ 
+ # Contract address (already included in the code but can be overridden)
+ REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42 
```

---

Now, let's run the application to make sure it works:

---

```bash
cd dashboard && npm start
```

---

I've created a TetriSeed Game admin dashboard for your deployed smart contract. The dashboard includes:

1. **Authentication system**:
   - Only allows access to the contract owner
   - Uses Web3Modal for wallet connection

2. **Dashboard features**:
   - View contract info (entry fee, prize pool, season info)
   - View current prize distribution 
   - Update entry fee
   - Change prize distribution percentages
   - Withdraw funds from contract
   - End season and distribute prizes to winners

3. **Styled UI**:
   - Retro game theme with pixelated font
   - Neon glow effects matching TetriSeed game aesthetic
   - Responsive card-based layout

To use the dashboard:

1. Start the development server (already running in background): `npm start`
2. Connect your wallet (must be the same address that deployed the contract)
3. Once authenticated, you'll have access to all management functions

The dashboard communicates directly with your deployed contract at `0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42` on SuperSeed Sepolia.

To deploy this to production, you can build the app with `npm run build` and host it on any static site hosting service.

_**User**_

Perfect, can we just change the page title from Tetriseed Game Admin Dashboard to "Tetriseed Admin", and add the same ico file as we have in the game frontend, and also the same logo as bacground for the dashboard?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll make those changes for you. First, let's update the page title:

---

```diff
      <meta
        name="description"
-       content="TetriSeed Game Admin Dashboard"
+       content="TetriSeed Admin Dashboard"
      />
      <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
      <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
-     <title>TetriSeed Game Admin Dashboard</title>
+     <title>TetriSeed Admin</title>
      <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Press+Start+2P&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
```

---

Now, I'll need to know where I can find the existing game favicon and logo. Could you provide me with:

1. The path to the game frontend's favicon.ico file
2. The path to the game logo that you'd like to use as a background

Once you provide those, I can copy them to the dashboard project and integrate them into the design.

---

_**User**_

you can copy the logo.ico from the public directory and the background from src/assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me copy those files for you and update the dashboard with them.

---

```bash
ls -la ../public
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ ls -la ../public
ls: ../public: No such file or directory
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$
```

---

Let me check for the correct path to the files:

---

```bash
find . -name "logo.ico" | grep -v node_modules
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ find . -name "logo.ico" | grep -v node_modules
./dist/logo.ico
./image_resources/logo.ico
./public/logo.ico
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$
```

---

```bash
find . -name "superseed_logo-removebg.png" | grep -v node_modules
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ find . -name "superseed_logo-removebg.png" | grep -v node_modul
es
./src/assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$
```

---

Now let's create the necessary directories in the dashboard project and copy the files:

---

```bash
mkdir -p dashboard/src/assets/images
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ 

```

---

```bash
cp ./public/logo.ico dashboard/public/favicon.ico && cp ./src/assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png dashboard/src/assets/images/
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ 

```

---

Now, let's verify the files were copied correctly:

---

```bash
ls -la dashboard/public/favicon.ico dashboard/src/assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png
```

```
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$ ls -la dashboard/public/favicon.ico dashboard/src/assets/images
/superseed_logo-removebg.png
-rw-r--r--@ 1 jes  staff   25017  9 abr 09:12 dashboard/public/favicon.ico
-rw-r--r--@ 1 jes  staff  174666  9 abr 09:12 dashboard/src/assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png
Mac-Studio-de-Jesus:SuperSeedSuperGame jes$
```

---

Great! Now let's update the styles to add the logo as a background. I'll modify the index.scss file:

---

```diff
    font-family: 'Press Start 2P', cursive;
    background-color: var(--bg-color);
+   background-image: url('../assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png');
+   background-position: center;
+   background-repeat: no-repeat;
+   background-size: 50%;
+   background-attachment: fixed;
+   background-blend-mode: soft-light;
    color: var(--text-color);
    line-height: 1.6;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 20px;
+   position: relative;
+   z-index: 1;
  }
  
  
  .card {
-   background: var(--card-bg);
+   background: rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.9);
    border: 2px solid var(--border-color);
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.2);
+   backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
    
    h2 {
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100vh;
+   position: relative;
+   z-index: 1;
    
    .auth-card {
-     background: var(--card-bg);
+     background: rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.9);
      border: 2px solid var(--border-color);
      padding: 30px;
      max-width: 400px;
      text-align: center;
+     backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
      
      h2 {
```

---

Let's also update the Login component to display the SuperSeed logo above the login form:

---

```diff
  import React, { useState } from 'react';
  import { connectWallet } from '../utils/web3';
+ import logoImg from '../assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png';
  
  const Login = ({ onLogin }) => {
      <div className="auth-container">
        <div className="auth-card">
-         <h2>TetriSeed Game Admin</h2>
+         <img 
+           src={logoImg} 
+           alt="TetriSeed Logo" 
+           style={{ width: '150px', marginBottom: '20px' }} 
+         />
+         <h2>TetriSeed Admin</h2>
          <p>Connect your wallet to manage the game contract</p>
          {error && <div className="error-message">{error}</div>}
```

---

Now, let's also add the logo to the Header component:

---

```diff
  import React from 'react';
  import { disconnectWallet } from '../utils/web3';
+ import logoImg from '../assets/images/superseed_logo-removebg.png';
  
  const Header = ({ address }) => {
    return (
      <header className="header">
+       <div style={{ display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center' }}>
+         <img 
+           src={logoImg} 
+           alt="TetriSeed Logo" 
+           style={{ width: '40px', marginRight: '15px' }} 
+         />
          <h1>TetriSeed Admin</h1>
+       </div>
        <div>
          <span className="eth-address">{formatAddress(address)}</span>
```

---

Let's also update the title in the manifest.json file to ensure consistency:

---

```diff
  {
    "short_name": "TetriSeed Admin",
-   "name": "TetriSeed Game Admin Dashboard",
+   "name": "TetriSeed Admin Dashboard",
    "icons": [
      {
    "display": "standalone",
    "theme_color": "#000000",
-   "background_color": "#ffffff"
+   "background_color": "#000000"

Perfect! I've made all the requested changes:

1. Changed the page title from "TetriSeed Game Admin Dashboard" to "TetriSeed Admin"
2. Added the logo.ico from your public directory as the favicon for the dashboard
3. Added the SuperSeed logo as:
   - A background image for the entire dashboard (with a subtle blend mode)
   - A visible logo in the login screen
   - A small icon in the header

The changes create a more cohesive look that matches your game's branding. The background has been styled with:
- Center positioning
- 50% size to make it not overwhelming
- A soft-light blend mode to ensure text remains readable
- Semi-transparent card backgrounds with backdrop blur to enhance readability

All components now use consistent branding and the dashboard has a unified style that matches the TetriSeed game aesthetic.

The dashboard ensures that only the contract owner can access these functions, providing a secure management interface.
+ 
+ ## Installation Guide
+ 
+ ### Prerequisites
+ 
+ Before installing the dashboard, ensure you have the following:
+ 
+ - Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
+ - npm (v6.0.0 or higher)
+ - A web browser with MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet extension installed
+ - Access to the SuperSeed Sepolia network in your wallet
+ - The private key of the account that deployed the contract (for admin access)
+ 
+ ### Setup
  
- 1. Clone this repository
- 2. Install dependencies:
+ 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
+    ```
+    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/tetriseed-admin-dashboard.git
+    cd tetriseed-admin-dashboard
+    ```
+ 
+ 2. Install the dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
- 3. Start the development server:
+ 
+ ### Environment Configuration
+ 
+ The dashboard uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project, using the `.env.example` file as a template:
+ 
+ ```
+ cp .env.example .env
+ ```
+ 
+ By default, the dashboard is configured to use the deployed contract at `0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42`. If you need to override this or change network settings, update the following variables in your `.env` file:
+ 
+ ```
+ REACT_APP_NETWORK_NAME=SuperSeed Sepolia Testnet
+ REACT_APP_CHAIN_ID=53302
+ REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Running the Dashboard
+ 
+ 1. Start the development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
- 4. Connect your wallet (must be the contract owner address)
- 
- ## Built With
- 
- - React - Frontend framework
- - ethers.js - Ethereum library for contract interaction
- - Web3Modal - Wallet connection library
- - SCSS - For styling
- 
- ## Smart Contract Interface
- 
- The dashboard interacts with the TetriSeed Game smart contract through its ABI and provides a user-friendly interface for all owner-only operations. 
+ 
+ 2. The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:3000
+ 
+ 3. For production deployment, build the optimized version:
+    ```
+    npm run build
+    ```
+ 
+    This creates a `build` directory with the production-ready files that can be deployed to any static hosting service.
+ 
+ ## Dashboard Functionality
+ 
+ ### Authentication
+ 
+ The dashboard uses Web3 wallet authentication to ensure only the contract owner can access administrative functions:
+ 
+ 1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your Ethereum wallet
+ 2. The dashboard verifies if the connected address is the contract owner
+ 3. If authentication is successful, you'll be granted access to the admin dashboard
+ 4. If the connected address is not the contract owner, access will be denied
+ 
+ ### Contract Information
+ 
+ The dashboard provides real-time information about the TetriSeed Game contract:
+ 
+ - **Entry Fee**: Current cost for players to enter the game (in ETH)
+ - **Prize Pool**: Total amount accumulated in the current season's prize pool (in ETH)
+ - **Current Season**: The active season number
+ - **Season Ends**: Date and time when the current season will end
+ - **Refresh Data**: Button to manually refresh contract data
+ 
+ ### Prize Distribution
+ 
+ The Prize Distribution card displays the current percentage breakdown of how prizes are distributed to winners:
+ 
+ - **Rank 1**: Percentage allocated to first place (default: 50%)
+ - **Rank 2**: Percentage allocated to second place (default: 30%)
+ - **Rank 3**: Percentage allocated to third place (default: 10%)
+ - **Rank 4**: Percentage allocated to fourth place (default: 5%)
+ - **Rank 5**: Percentage allocated to fifth place (default: 5%)
+ 
+ ### Administrative Functions
+ 
+ #### Update Entry Fee
+ 
+ Allows the admin to change the cost for players to enter the game:
+ 
+ 1. Enter the new fee amount in ETH (e.g., 0.0001)
+ 2. Click "Update Fee"
+ 3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
+ 4. Wait for the transaction to be processed
+ 5. The dashboard will display a success message when complete
+ 
+ #### Update Prize Distribution
+ 
+ Modify how prizes are distributed among the top 5 winners:
+ 
+ 1. Enter percentages for each rank (Ranks 1-5)
+ 2. Ensure the percentages add up to exactly 100%
+ 3. Click "Update Distribution"
+ 4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
+ 5. Wait for the transaction to be processed
+ 6. The dashboard will display the updated distribution once complete
+ 
+ #### Withdraw Funds
+ 
+ The contract owner can withdraw ETH from the prize pool:
+ 
+ 1. Enter the amount to withdraw in ETH
+ 2. Click "Withdraw"
+ 3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
+ 4. The funds will be transferred to the owner's wallet
+ 
+ > **Note**: Excessive withdrawals will reduce the prize pool available to winners. Use this function judiciously.
+ 
+ #### End Season & Distribute Prizes
+ 
+ At the end of a season, the admin can distribute prizes to the top 5 players:
+ 
+ 1. Enter the Ethereum addresses of the top 5 winners in order of their ranking
+ 2. Click "End Season"
+ 3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
+ 4. The contract will:
+    - Distribute prizes according to the set percentages
+    - Reset the prize pool
+    - Increment the season number
+    - Start a new season
+ 
+ > **Important**: All winner addresses must be valid Ethereum addresses. Duplicates are not allowed.
+ 
+ ## Security
+ 
+ The dashboard implements several security features:
+ 
+ - **Owner Authentication**: Only the contract owner can access the dashboard
+ - **Secure Wallet Connection**: Uses Web3Modal for secure wallet integration
+ - **Transaction Confirmation**: All administrative actions require explicit wallet confirmation
+ - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all contract interactions
+ 
+ ## Technology Stack
+ 
+ - **Frontend**: React.js
+ - **Styling**: SCSS with retro gaming aesthetics

- ## SuperSeed Deployment Guide
- 
- ### Prerequisites
- 
- 1. Make sure you have ETH on the SuperSeed Sepolia testnet to pay for gas fees
- 2. Set up your `.env` file with your wallet's private key
- 
- ### Configuration
- 
- The deployment to SuperSeed is configured in `hardhat.config.js` with the following settings:
- - Network name: `superseedSepolia`
- - RPC URL: `https://sepolia.superseed.xyz`
- - Chain ID: `53302`
- - Gas price: `1 gwei` (as recommended in the SuperSeed documentation)
- 
- ### Deployment Options
- 
- The deployment script (`scripts/deploy-superseed.js`) offers two options:
- 
- 1. **Deploy with an existing $SUPR token**:
-    - Set the `SUPR_TOKEN_ADDRESS` in your `.env` file to use an existing token
-    - The TetriSeedGame contract will be configured to use this token address
- 
- 2. **Deploy with a mock $SUPR token**:
-    - Leave the `SUPR_TOKEN_ADDRESS` empty in your `.env` file
-    - The script will automatically deploy a MockSUPR token first
-    - Then it will deploy TetriSeedGame using the MockSUPR address
- 
- ### After Deployment
- 
- After successful deployment, you will see the deployed contract addresses in the console. Make note of these addresses for frontend integration.
- 
- ## Contract Details
-

- ### SuperSeed Compatibility
- 
- The contract is fully compatible with SuperSeed (an OP Stack chain):
- - Uses ETH for gas (standard on OP Stack)
- - No custom opcodes or address aliasing used
- - Optimized gas usage (limited loops, efficient storage)
- - Should work well within SuperSeed's high block gas limit (~30 million)
- 
- ### MockSUPR
- 
- - ERC-20 token for testing
- - Has mint functionality for testing purposes
- 
- ### Integration with Frontend
- 
- The frontend will interact with the TetriSeedGame contract to:
- 1. Allow players to enter competitive games by paying the entry fee
- 2. Permit additional token deposits to the prize pool
- 3. Display current prize pool amounts
- 4. Show prize distribution percentages
- 5. Present leaderboards of top players
- 6. Show current and historical season information 
+    Or use the npm script:
+    ```bash
+    npm run deploy:superseed
+    ```
+ 
+ ### Mainnet Deployment
+ 
+ For production deployment to Ethereum mainnet or other networks:
+ 
+ 1. Ensure your `.env` file is configured with your private key
+ 2. Update the `hardhat.config.js` file with the network configuration (if not already present)
+ 3. Run the deployment script:

+ 
+ ## ABI and Integration
+ 
+ ### Accessing the ABI
+ 
+ After compilation, the ABI (Application Binary Interface) will be available in the `artifacts` directory:
+ 
+ ```
+ artifacts/contracts/TetriSeedGame.sol/TetriSeedGame.json
+ ```
+ 
+ You can extract the ABI for frontend integration:
+ 
+ ```javascript
+ const contractArtifact = require('./artifacts/contracts/TetriSeedGame.sol/TetriSeedGame.json');
+ const contractABI = contractArtifact.abi;
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Frontend Integration Example
+ 
+ Here's a simple example of integrating the contract with a frontend using ethers.js:
+ 
+ ```javascript
+ import { ethers } from 'ethers';
+ import TetriSeedGameABI from './TetriSeedGame.json';
+ 
+ // Contract address (from deployment)
+ const contractAddress = '0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42';
+ 
+ // Connect to provider (MetaMask)
+ const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
+ const signer = provider.getSigner();
+ 
+ // Create contract instance
+ const tetriSeedGame = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, TetriSeedGameABI.abi, signer);
+ 
+ // Get contract data
+ async function getContractData() {
+   const entryFee = await tetriSeedGame.entryFee();
+   const prizePool = await tetriSeedGame.weeklyPrizePool();
+   const currentSeason = await tetriSeedGame.currentSeason();
+   const seasonEndTime = await tetriSeedGame.getCurrentSeasonEndTime();
+   
+   return {
+     entryFee: ethers.utils.formatEther(entryFee),
+     prizePool: ethers.utils.formatEther(prizePool),
+     currentSeason: currentSeason.toString(),
+     seasonEndTime: new Date(seasonEndTime.toNumber() * 1000).toLocaleString()
+   };
+ }
+ 
+ // Enter a game
+ async function enterGame() {
+   const fee = await tetriSeedGame.entryFee();
+   const tx = await tetriSeedGame.enterGame({ value: fee });
+   await tx.wait();
+   return tx.hash;
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## Security Features
+ 
+ The TetriSeedGame contract incorporates several security features:
+ 
+ 1. **Reentrancy Protection**: Uses OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks.
+ 
+ 2. **Access Control**: Administrative functions are protected with OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` modifier.
+ 
+ 3. **Input Validation**: Extensive validation for all inputs including:
+    - Duplicate winner address detection
+    - Zero address checks
+    - Prize distribution percentage validation
+ 
+ 4. **Integer Overflow Protection**: Uses Solidity 0.8's built-in overflow checking.
+ 
+ 5. **Secure ETH Handling**: Careful management of ETH transfers with proper error handling.
+ 
+ 6. **Event Emission**: All state changes emit events for transparency and auditability.
  
  ## Security Audit Results
  ### Strengths
  
- - **Reentrancy Protection**: The contract properly implements OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier on all functions that involve token transfers, protecting against reentrancy attacks.
+ - **Reentrancy Protection**: The contract properly implements OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier on all functions that involve ETH transfers.
  - **Authorization Controls**: Administrative functions are secured with the `onlyOwner` modifier, ensuring only the contract owner can execute them.
  - **Input Validation**: The contract includes thorough checks for edge cases such as duplicate winner addresses and zero addresses.
  - **Arithmetic Safety**: Solidity 0.8's built-in overflow protection is utilized throughout the contract.
- - **Token Transfer Safety**: OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library is properly implemented for all token operations.
  - **Event Transparency**: Events are emitted for all significant state changes, providing transparency and off-chain tracking capabilities.
  
  
  1. **Winner Selection**: The primary trust assumption is that the contract owner (admin) will provide legitimate winners, as there is no on-chain verification of game results.
- 2. **Fund Management**: By design, players cannot withdraw their deposited tokens. Tokens remain in the contract for prize distribution or future game entries.
+ 2. **Fund Management**: By design, players cannot withdraw their deposited ETH. ETH remains in the contract for prize distribution or future game entries.
  
  ### Recommendations for Trust Minimization
  1. **Multi-signature Ownership**: Consider implementing a multi-sig wallet as the contract owner to require multiple parties to agree on winner selection.
  2. **Time-locked Operations**: Add a timelock to critical administrative functions to allow community review of proposed changes.
- 3. **On-chain Verification**: Long-term, develop mechanisms for on-chain verification of game results, such as:
-    - Recording game scores on-chain
-    - Using verifiable random functions for fairness components
-    - Implementing zero-knowledge proofs for score verification
+ 3. **On-chain Verification**: Long-term, develop mechanisms for on-chain verification of game results.
  4. **Emergency Controls**: Implement a circuit breaker/pausable pattern to halt the contract in emergency situations.
  5. **Automated Season Management**: Use Chainlink Keepers or similar services to automate season transitions.
  
- ### Conclusion
- 
- The TetriSeedGame contract implements security best practices through the use of OpenZeppelin libraries and careful input validation. The intentional design choice to keep player deposits within the contract ecosystem is a business decision that should be clearly communicated to users. The primary trust concern involves the centralized control of winner selection, which could be mitigated through the recommendations outlined above.
- 
- The complete test suite validates that the contract behavior matches the expected functionality, with particular focus on prize distribution, input validation, and reentrancy protection. 
+ ## Troubleshooting
+ 
+ ### Common Issues
+ 
+ 1. **Insufficient Gas**: Ensure your wallet has enough ETH to cover the gas costs for contract deployment and interactions.
+ 
+    **Solution**: Fund your wallet with additional ETH before attempting deployment or interaction.
+ 
+ 2. **Network Configuration**: Incorrect RPC URL or chain ID in the Hardhat configuration.
+ 
+    **Solution**: Verify network settings in `hardhat.config.js` match the target network.
+ 
+ 3. **Contract Verification**: Failed contract verification on block explorers.
+ 
+    **Solution**: Use the correct compiler version and optimization settings when verifying contracts.
+ 
+ 4. **Prize Distribution Failure**: Transaction reverts when trying to end a season.
+ 
+    **Solution**: Ensure all winner addresses are valid, non-zero, and non-duplicate.
+ 
+ 5. **Private Key Security**: Exposing private key in code or GitHub.
+ 
+    **Solution**: Always use environment variables for private keys and include `.env` in `.gitignore`.
+ 
+ ### Debugging
+ 
+ For detailed debugging, use Hardhat's built-in debugging capabilities:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ npx hardhat console --network <network>
+ ```
+ 
+ This provides an interactive JavaScript console where you can interact with contracts and debug issues.

- ## 🔧 Technologies
- 
- TetriSeed is built with modern web technologies:
- 
- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Frontend framework
- - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool and development server
- - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- - [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web server framework

+ ```
+ 
+ ### Data Flow
+ 
+ 1. **Game Initialization**:
+    - Frontend loads assets and connects to server
+    - If competitive mode, connects to wallet and smart contract
+ 
+ 2. **Gameplay**:
+    - Game state managed client-side
+    - Scores submitted to server via API
+    - Competitive play verified through blockchain
+ 
+ 3. **Season End**:
+    - Contract owner uses admin dashboard
+    - Smart contract distributes prizes
+    - Leaderboard resets for new season
  
  ## ❓ Troubleshooting
  
- ### Common Issues and Solutions
- 
- #### Port already in use
- 
- If you see an error like `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000`:
- 
- ```bash
- # Kill the process using the port (on Unix/Mac)
- pkill -f "node.*server"
- 
- # Or for Windows
- netstat -ano | findstr :3000
- taskkill /PID <PID> /F
- ```
- 
- #### Leaderboard not loading
- 
- Make sure:
- 1. The server is running
- 2. The `public/data` directory exists and is writable
- 3. Check for errors in the browser console or server logs
- 
- #### MetaMask Connection Issues
- 
- If you're having trouble connecting your MetaMask wallet:
- 
- 1. Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- 2. Make sure you're on a supported network (SuperSeed network)
- 3. If the network is not available, the game will prompt you to add it
- 4. Check for console errors related to wallet connection
- 5. Try refreshing the page and reconnecting
- 
- #### Competitive Mode Not Working
- 
- If competitive mode isn't working:
- 
- 1. Ensure your MetaMask wallet is properly connected
- 2. Make sure you have sufficient $SUPR tokens for game entry
- 3. Check the network connection to the SuperSeed blockchain
- 4. See browser console for more detailed error messages

  ## 🚀 Deployment
  
- ### Deploying to Netlify
+ ### Game Deployment
  
- TetriSeed can be easily deployed to Netlify for free hosting:
+ To build the game for production:
  
- 1. Build the production version:
-    ```bash
-    npm run build
-    ```
+ ```bash
+ npm run build
+ ```
  
- 2. Deploy using one of these methods:
- 
-    **Method 1: Direct upload** (Quick testing)
-    - Go to [Netlify's dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/)
-    - Sign up or log in
-    - Drag and drop the `dist` folder to the upload area
-    - Netlify will deploy your site and provide a URL
- 
-    **Method 2: Connect to Git repository** (Continuous deployment)
-    - Create a new site in Netlify
-    - Connect your GitHub repository
-    - Set build command to `npm run build`
-    - Set publish directory to `dist`
-    - Deploy the site
- 
- ### Setting Up the Backend Server
- 
- For the leaderboard functionality to work, you'll need to deploy the server component:
- 
- 1. Deploy the server to a platform like [Render](https://render.com/), [Railway](https://railway.app/), or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- 
- 2. Update the server URL in the API configuration:
-    - Open `src/utils/apiConfig.js`
-    - Replace the placeholder URL with your actual deployed server URL:
-      ```javascript
-      const API_URL = {
-        development: '', // Empty for development (uses proxy)
-        production: 'https://your-actual-server-url.com' // ← Update this
-      };
-      ```
- 
- 3. Rebuild and redeploy the frontend after updating the API URL.
- 
- ### Testing Deployed API Endpoints
- 
- After deployment, you can test that your API endpoints are working:
- 
- 1. Visit your deployed frontend URL
- 2. Open the browser's developer tools (F12)
- 3. Check the Network tab when the game loads
- 4. Verify that requests to `/api/leaderboard` and `/api/competitive-leaderboard` are successfully connecting to your server
- 
- If there are issues with CORS, ensure your server is properly configured to accept requests from your Netlify domain.
+ This creates a `dist` directory with optimized files ready for deployment to any static hosting service.
+ 
+ ### Server Deployment
+ 
+ For production server deployment:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ cd server
+ npm install --production
+ NODE_ENV=production node index.js
+ ```
+ 
+ Consider using a process manager like PM2:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ npm install -g pm2
+ pm2 start index.js --name tetriseed-server
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Contract Verification
+ 
+ After deployment, verify your contract on block explorers:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ npx hardhat verify --network superseedSepolia 0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42
+ ```
+ 
+ ### Dashboard Deployment
+ 
+ Build the dashboard for production:
+ 
+ ```bash
+ cd dashboard
+ npm run build
+ ```
+ 
+ The resulting `build` directory can be deployed to any static hosting service.
