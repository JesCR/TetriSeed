Based on the files I've checked from April 6, 2025, I can now provide a comprehensive list of fixes, upgrades, and new functionalities that were implemented on that day:

# April 6, 2025 - Updates and Fixes

## UI Layout Improvements
1. **Uniform Height Adjustment for Game UI** - Standardized the height of game info boxes (score, rows, level) and buttons to create a more consistent UI layout.

2. **Aligning App Content for Better Layout** - Reduced excessive vertical spacing at the top of the application, making better use of the screen real estate.

3. **Game Header Width Adjustment** - Fixed misalignment between the game header and game content by adjusting width to match the right border of the leaderboard.

4. **Fixed Web Scroll and Keyboard Controls** - Solved an issue where pressing arrow keys caused the webpage to scroll up or down while also controlling the game piece.
   - Added `preventDefault()` to keyboard event handlers
   - Modified CSS to reduce vertical space usage
   - Improved touch handling to prevent scrolling
   - Made overall layout more compact to prevent unnecessary scrolling

## New Functionality
1. **Down Key Long Press Behavior** - Added functionality to make tetrominos fall faster when the down key/button is held down, similar to the original Tetris game.
   - Implemented for both keyboard and mobile controls
   - Created interval-based system for continuous movement
   - Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

2. **Security Audit for Anti-Cheat Measures** - Explored ways to enhance security by restricting access to browser developer tools without JavaScript obfuscation.

3. **Footer Design with Links and Message** - Added a footer component with:
   - Link to the GitHub project
   - Link to the developer's Twitter
   - Link to the Tesla Contest
   - "Made with love for SuperSeed community" message with a red heart

## Bug Fixes
1. **Score Not Saved and Leaderboard Issue** - Fixed a problem where competitive mode scores weren't being saved and the leaderboard wasn't updating.
   - The issue was in the `submitScore` function having an empty dependency array in `useCallback`, causing it to use stale values
   - Added proper dependencies to the function to ensure it had access to the latest state

2. **Modal UI Improvements** - Enhanced the game-over modal that displays the screenshot:
   - Fixed screenshot size in the modal
   - Improved spacing between elements
   - Made buttons more consistent in size and appearance
   - Added better styling for the sharing options

These updates collectively improved the user experience, fixed critical bugs, and added new features that enhance gameplay in the SuperSeed game.
