# Replacing Emoji with Logo in JSX Files (2025-04-09 17:46:07)

_**User**_

can we try replacing the ðŸ’°in Cell.jsx and NextPiece.jsx with the src/assets/images/logo_og.svg ?

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you replace the money bag emoji with the logo SVG in both Cell.jsx and NextPiece.jsx. Let me first check the NextPiece.jsx file and then make the changes.

Read file: src/assets/images/logo_og.svg

---

Now that I have the necessary information, I'll update both files to replace the money bag emoji with the SVG logo.

---

```diff
  import { memo } from 'react';
  import { TETROMINOS } from '../utils/tetrisUtils';
+ // Import the logo SVG
+ import logoSvg from '../assets/images/logo_og.svg';
  
  const Cell = ({ type, cellState }) => {
    const color = TETROMINOS[tetrominoType].color;
    
-   // Display a money bag emoji for all non-empty cells
-   const content = type === 0 ? '' : 'ðŸ’°';
+   // Instead of emoji, use an image element for non-empty cells
+   const content = type === 0 ? '' : <img src={logoSvg} alt="Logo" style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', objectFit: 'contain' }} />;
    
    // Determine if this cell is in a clearing row
```

---

Now let's update the NextPiece.jsx file:

---

```diff
  import React from 'react';
  import { TETROMINOS } from '../utils/tetrisUtils';
+ // Import the logo SVG
+ import logoSvg from '../assets/images/logo_og.svg';
  
- // Special cell component for the next piece preview with the ðŸ’° symbol
+ // Special cell component for the next piece preview with the logo
  const NextPieceCell = ({ type }) => {
    // Determine which Tetromino type to use for styling
    const tetrominoType = typeof type === 'string' && type !== '0' ? type : 0;
    const color = TETROMINOS[tetrominoType].color;
    
-   // Display money bag emoji for non-empty cells
-   const content = type === 0 ? '' : 'ðŸ’°';
+   // Use SVG logo instead of emoji for non-empty cells
+   const content = type === 0 ? '' : <img src={logoSvg} alt="Logo" style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', objectFit: 'contain' }} />;
    
    return (
```

---

I've successfully replaced the money bag emoji (ðŸ’°) with the SVG logo in both files:

1. In Cell.jsx: Added an import for the logo SVG and replaced the emoji with an img element that displays the logo with proper styling for size and fit.

2. In NextPiece.jsx: Similarly added the SVG import and replaced the emoji in the NextPieceCell component with an img element using the same styling.

The SVG logo should now appear in place of the money bag emoji throughout your game. The image is set to fill the available space in each cell while maintaining its aspect ratio.

maybe in the nextcell is better to have it clean, with nothing inside (no moneybag no logo)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the NextPieceCell component to have nothing inside non-empty cells. Let me make that change:

---

```diff
  import logoSvg from '../assets/images/logo_og.svg';
  
- // Special cell component for the next piece preview with the logo
+ // Special cell component for the next piece preview with clean cells
  const NextPieceCell = ({ type }) => {
    // Determine which Tetromino type to use for styling
    const tetrominoType = typeof type === 'string' && type !== '0' ? type : 0;
    const color = TETROMINOS[tetrominoType].color;
    
-   // Use SVG logo instead of emoji for non-empty cells
-   const content = type === 0 ? '' : <img src={logoSvg} alt="Logo" style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%', objectFit: 'contain' }} />;
+   // Empty content for all cells
+   const content = '';
    
    return (
```

---

I've updated the NextPieceCell component in NextPiece.jsx to have clean cells with nothing inside them. The main changes were:

1. Changed the comment to indicate these are now "clean cells"
2. Replaced the conditional content with an empty string (`''`) for all cells
3. Kept all the styling for the cell borders and colors

Now the next piece preview will show colored blocks with no content inside them (no money bag emoji or logo), creating a cleaner look while still making it easy to see the next piece's shape.
