# Adjusting Superseed Facts Update Interval (2025-04-09 18:46:00)

_**User**_

by default superseed facts update every 10 seconds, let's reduce that to every 6 seconds

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the SuperseedFacts component to reduce the fact rotation interval from 10 seconds to 6 seconds.

---

```diff
        }, 150); // Duration of first flash
        
-     }, 10000); // Update every 10 seconds
+     }, 6000); // Update every 6 seconds
      
      return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
```

---

I've updated the SuperseedFacts component to show a new fact every 6 seconds instead of 10 seconds. The animation flash effect will still work as before, but facts will rotate more frequently now.
