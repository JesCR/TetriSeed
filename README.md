## üìñ Overview

TetriSeed is a blockchain-integrated Tetris game with a SuperSeed DeFi protocol theme. The project consists of four main components:

1. **Game Frontend**: The main Tetris game with casual and competitive modes
2. **Backend Server**: Manages leaderboards, scores, and player data
3. **Smart Contracts**: Handles competitive mode entry fees and prize distribution
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Contract management interface for administrative operations

This project showcases the integration of traditional gaming with blockchain technology, allowing players to compete for real rewards in a seasonal competition system.

## üß© Components

### Game Frontend

The game frontend is built with React and Vite, offering two gameplay modes:

- **Casual Mode**: Free-to-play mode without blockchain integration
- **Competitive Mode**: Blockchain-integrated mode requiring entry fees and offering prizes

[Detailed Game Documentation](./src/README.md)

### Server

The server component handles:
- Score tracking and leaderboard management
- User authentication
- Season management
- Data persistence

[Server Documentation](./server/README.md)

### Smart Contracts

The smart contracts handle the financial aspects of the competitive mode:

- Entry fee collection in ETH
- Prize pool management
- Automated season transitions
- Prize distribution to top players

[Smart Contracts Documentation](./contracts/README.md)

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides contract owners with:

- Contract monitoring (entry fees, prize pools, etc.)
- Administrative functions (update fees, distribute prizes)
- Season management
- Security controls

[Admin Dashboard Documentation](./dashboard/README.md)

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.0.0 or higher)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet (for competitive mode and contract deployment)
- Access to the SuperSeed network (for competitive mode)

### Game Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JesCR/SuperSeedSuperGame.git
   cd SuperSeedSuperGame
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xd9b4190777287eAD1473A5EE44aA2a6aAE3b7b42
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Server Setup

1. **Navigate to the server directory**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install server dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```

5. **Deploy to the SuperSeed Sepolia testnet**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-eth.js --network superseedSepolia
   ```

   After deployment, note the contract address for frontend integration.

### Dashboard Setup

## üèÜ Competitive Mode

TetriSeed's competitive mode offers a blockchain-integrated gaming experience:

### How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask to connect to SuperSeed Sepolia network
2. **Pay Entry Fee**: Entry costs 0.0001 ETH per game
3. **Play & Compete**: Your highest score is recorded on the leaderboard
4. **Seasonal Rewards**: At the end of each week (season), prizes are distributed

### Prize Distribution

- **1st Place**: 50% of the prize pool
- **2nd Place**: 30% of the prize pool
- **3rd Place**: 10% of the prize pool
- **4th Place**: 5% of the prize pool
- **5th Place**: 5% of the prize pool

### Season Schedule

- Each season runs from Monday 00:00 UTC to Sunday 23:59 UTC
- After each season ends, prizes are distributed and a new season begins
- Season history is viewable in the game interface

```

### Data Flow

1. **Game Initialization**:
   - Frontend loads assets and connects to server
   - If competitive mode, connects to wallet and smart contract

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Game state managed client-side
   - Scores submitted to server via API
   - Competitive play verified through blockchain

3. **Season End**:
   - Contract owner uses admin dashboard
   - Smart contract distributes prizes
   - Leaderboard resets for new season

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Game Issues

#### Game Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Try clearing cache and reloading

#### Wallet Connection Problems
- Verify MetaMask is installed and unlocked
- Check you're on the SuperSeed Sepolia network (Chain ID: 53302)
- If the network is missing, add it manually:
  - Network Name: SuperSeed Sepolia
  - RPC URL: https://sepolia.superseed.xyz
  - Chain ID: 53302
  - Currency Symbol: ETH

#### Leaderboard Not Updating
- Ensure the server is running
- Check server logs for API errors
- Verify network connectivity

### Contract Issues

#### Failed Transactions
- Ensure you have enough ETH for gas
- Check transaction parameters
- Verify you have the correct permissions (for admin functions)

#### Prize Distribution Errors
- Ensure all winner addresses are valid
- Check prize pool has sufficient funds
- Verify season has ended

### Server Issues

#### Server Won't Start
- Check for port conflicts
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify node version (`node -v`) is 14.0.0 or higher

#### Data Persistence Problems
- Check file permissions in the data directory
- Ensure CSV files are not corrupted
- Backup data before any server modifications
